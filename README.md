"Heroes, Thieves and Moneylenders" mod for BG2, BG2EE, BGT, EET

The mod consists of several independent components:

Component 1. «Interjections & Mini-quests» (by Austin & Arcanecoast Team):

- expansion of reactions of NPC (party members) to story events SoA&ToB
- a few new mini-quests (for example, if Cernd in the party, a mini-quest with milking a cow in the Slums will be available, in the Government District a nobleman will give a new quest, etc.
- new NPC reactions to killing powerful monsters (dragons, lich Kangaxx)
- new dialogs between the protagonist and the NPC (for example, a large dialogue with Edwin in the Underdark)
- new banters between NPCs
- when you guess riddles in Spellhold, your companions will no longer be silent! Each of them (including the cross-mod NPCs from "BG1 NPCs in BG2" mod) will give their opinion on the riddles!
- extended solution to the quest about Kaza book, if the group has Keldorn, Edwin or both together (in this case, there will be a dispute between them)
- expansion of some standard quests. For example, to Umar Hills, the quest with the extraction of a gem from a chicken can now be solved in many ways - from using your ranger or druid skills to attracting NPC druids and NPC rangers
- after completing quests in Trademeet and defeating Firkraag, in taverns, you may meet a storyteller telling about it (but be prepared that in his stories everything will be presented a little differently from what it really was)
- after installing statues in Trademeet, the names of specific NPC companions will now be written on them, and not a general non-specific phrase
- Keldorn and Cernd's reaction to each other's family quests (if someone's quest is completed before the other and both are in a group)
- and other

Component 2. «First Calimport Bank Pack» (by Scheele & Austin & Arcanecoast Team):

Adds a new bank area on the Waukeen Promenade, quests, miniquests and various dialogues related to the bank, as well as an additional quest in Brynnlaw at three new areas, many new characters (and on the EE version, the two creatures will also have new animations). New area maps drawn by [b]Gorion[/b].
In the bank, you can open an account, top up the balance, check the balance and withdraw money from the account. Each game week, 2% of the total amount will be added to the account.
There are two different ways to get quests - one quest branch will start if there is Korgan in the group and completed his quest about Kaza's book, and the second - if the player agrees to help the half-orc collector that the player will meet. 
The beginning of one of the two quest branch will block the parallel quest branch, so both options can be completed only with two different playthroughs of the game. 
In this case, both branches will end with the quest "Pirate Legacy".
If you successfully complete the first branch of the quests, you can also ask a new ally for help in the fight against Bodhi in Chapter 6.

Component 3. «Shadow-Covered Love & Death» (by Alisia & Austin):

Adds:
- for female characters: a big romance with the head of the thieves guild Aran Linvail (as with a non-group NPC) and a series of new quests (from large to microquests) that will become available as this relationship develops. Also included are flirting, reactions of other NPCs, a small episode in ToB, a new epilogue of the game with an active romance, and more!
- for male characters, this component adds two quests in the Thieves guild: the first quest will be given by Renal after completing his task (wait for the messenger on the street) in chapter 3, and the second major quest will be given by Aran after the death of Bodhi in chapter 6, provided that the player earlier took control of stronghold thieves.
Take your time to complete the third chapter, there is a lot of new things in it!

Component 4. «The Missing Troll Case» (by Alisia & Austin):

Adds two new interconnected detective-focused quests to SoA. The story begins after the player solves a problem with the Waukeen Promenade circus. Expect a messenger from the circus with a problem report.
This component has one new area.

Component 5. "Unlocked original NPC reactions"(by Tipun & Austin): 
There were situations in the game when only one of all the NPCs spoke, although the developers provided replicas for each. After installing this component, all NPCs in the party will speak.


Compatibility:

BG2, BG2EE, BGT, EET
It is better to install AFTER all mods adding new NPCs (otherwise their names will not appear on statues in Trademeet, and cross-mod content will not be used)
Compatible with "Romantic Encounters" mod ("Aran" episode) - while installing this episode and our romance with Aran, the content from "Aran" episode will not appear in the game. Added checks to disable this episode because they have a similar scene in our romance, but with further continuation of the romance. The consent of Kulyok (the author of the parallel episode) was obtained - she herself advised this solution.

Explanations:

In component 2:
To start the "Mae’Var’s Stash" quest, you need to have Edwin in the party during the last dialogue with Renal, while the player must NOT own a stronghold of thieves and must NOT have an orderly and good outlook.
There are also differences between the content of the mod on the EE version and in the classic version of the game. For technical reasons, I had to make some characters with different types of animation (this applies to Odrik and the Monster in the second component - they have new animation for EE, and the old one for the classic version), as well as different melodies in new locations (they are new on EE, on the classic versions are standard).

In component 3:
To activate the romance, it is necessary that the PC is female, by class - a thief (single or multiclass), by alignment - NOT lawful good, by intellect - above 12, by charisma - above 8, by race - human, elf or half-elf. You also need to complete Renal's standard quests and kill Mae'Var, as well as complete the first standard task from Aran. After that, in one day, you will receive a letter from which everything will begin.
To receive the largest quest, it is also necessary that the PC does not give up managing her guild (the loss of the guild is allowed, but initially it must be obtained).
Also, in order to see all the content, you need to select the option in one of the key dialogs in which the PC makes a promise to Aran (which one will be clear from the text). If you choose another option, the romance will be in a semi-active state, some episodes will not be displayed, but the possibility of parallel romance with other characters will remain.
For male characters, this component adds one major quest, which Aran will issue after Bodhi's death in Chapter 6, provided that the player previously took control of stronghold thieves.

In component 4:
The new quest will begin one day after the circus is freed (wait for a messenger from Quayle). Launch conditions - must stay alive with Quayle and Aerie (in the group or not - it doesn't matter) and chapter 2 must begin.
If any mods are installed on Quayle, then the quest will still be available, but with additional conditions:
-If Smiling Imp's Quayle is installed ("BG1 NPC to BG2"): if Quayle is not already in the party, the quest will start as usual. If Quayle is already in the group, then the quest will start if Aerie is also in the group.
-If the Lava’s Quayle mod is installed: the quest will start if Quayle has not yet joined the group and Aerie is alive.
