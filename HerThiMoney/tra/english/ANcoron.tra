// In the Copper Coronet
@0 = ~ This is nothing new, girl. Many people are happy to accept help, but not everyone is willing to help someone in return. When you do good for someone, do not expect gratitude and reciprocation - it keeps you from being disappointed in people. ~
@1 = ~ So we are supposed agree to help without even knowing who our opponent is? Consider the risk, <CHARNAME> ... ~
@2 = ~ The girl asks for help, Valygar. We have no right to refuse her. The Order would not forgive me for this. ~
@3 = ~ Are we supposed to help everyone we meet now? Soon, we will be retrieving cats stuck in trees for street children. (Although, I must admit, this girl is beautiful and clearly from a noble family.) ~
@4 = ~ We need money, and here we can both help the girl and make good money. Just like my cousin Rintin when he sold a large batch of turnips to the mayor of a village suffering from an ogre invasion. People were starving there, so he gave them a big discount. True, later it turned out that the turnips were a little rotten, and he was just looking for someone to sell them to before they completely deteriorated. But the villagers still found them useful. They fed those turnips to the ogres who occupied the village, and they poisoned themselves and died. The moral of the story is that you need to help your neighbor, and that turnips are useful even if they are rotten. ~
@5 = ~ 'Companionship'? <CHARNAME>, does he mean that some of our companions are there and they are waiting for us? Minsc and Boo are always happy to have friends!~
@6 = ~ Ahem, I meant something else. ~
@7 = ~ It seems suspicious that you are offering so much money and singling us out. It's like you've been waiting for us. ~
@8 = ~ You are free to refuse. But, believe me, I spare no expense for important tasks. You shouldn't see everything as a conspiracy. ~
