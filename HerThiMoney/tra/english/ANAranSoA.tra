// Episode 1. Dinner, prologue

@427 = ~My lady <CHARNAME>! Whew, just barely caught up with you! You've got a letter. I am Tony, by the way, nice to meet you.~
@428 = ~(You open the letter and find, to your surprise, that it is a dinner invitation from Aran Linvail himself. He is asking you to come alone. What could it possibly mean? You should go and find out)~
@429 = ~(Aran Linvail welcomes you to his chambers where a table for two is already set. The Shadow Master is the very soul of courtesy and friendliness. While sharing a bottle of some expensive vintage, you have a lovely chat about weather, nature, the new theater troupe on tour from Sigil, the latest gossip from Waukeen's Promenade, slowly approaching the topics that seem to be the main reason for this meeting)~
@430 = ~I'm glad that you escaped from this Irenicus's grasp, and I'm twice as glad that, however indirectly, my people had something to do with this. Don't be surprised, <CHARNAME>, I know more about you than you think.~
@431 = ~Have your people been following me?~
@432 = ~Not exactly following you. But when the Iron crisis hit the Coast, and Amn got the blame, when things started to smell of war, I sent my people to Baldur's Gate to report on the state of affairs. Would you be surprised to know that your name started to appear in these reports more and more often? After all, you were the one who finally put a stop to all this ruckus.~
@433 = ~Yes. It was not easy, but I did it.~
@434 = ~I was not thinking about any of this then. I just wanted to find the truth about myself.~
@435 = ~While striving to take revenge on Sarevok for Gorion's death, I inadvertently stopped a war. How strange...~
@436 = ~I was just doing what I had to. I did not want to become any type of savior.~
@437 = ~You know, I liked getting more and more power, becoming someone to be reckoned with.~
@438 = ~Whatever your reasons, you have done a great deed. I am happy I did not have to resort to measures I kept in store in case of war. Many people should be grateful to you, <CHARNAME>. All the more amazing that fate should make our paths cross under these unsettling circumstances.~
@439 = ~Despite the circumstances I'm glad to have made your acquaintance, Aran.~
@440 = ~Oh, Irenicus will pay for everything!~
@441 = ~Moreover, it turns out we have mutual enemies.~
@442 = ~Have no doubt, the feeling is mutual.~
@443 = ~It would please me if I could help make it happen.~
@444 = ~Who will be crushed sooner or later by our joint effort.~
@445 = ~More wine? Allow me... So listen, <CHARNAME>... You did very well in that business with Mae'Var. You know, our guild doesn't just employ pickpockets and backstabbers. Sorcery or swordsmanship, a bard's tongue or a ranger's eye can be as useful as a dagger or a lockpick. Would you like to continue working with the Shadow Guild? You can go about your business, and nobody needs to know you're one of ours. Just come when we need you, and so shall we come when you need our help.~
@446 = ~More wine? Allow me... So listen, <CHARNAME>... it is a great pity that you declined the offer Renal made you. After all, you took care of Mae'Var splendidly. Even if you don't need a guild of your own, I hope you agree to continue working with the Shadow Thieves. You can go about your business and nobody needs to know you're one of ours. Just come when we need you, and so shall we come when you need our help.~
@447 = ~More wine? Allow me... So listen, <CHARNAME>... I'm very pleased you accepted Renal's offer. The Shadow Thieves need people like you. I realize you're going to have your hands full with your new guild, but what do you think if I offer you something more interesting and more challenging soon?~
@448 = ~This is an unexpected and tempting offer. I think I'll take it.~
@449 = ~No, Aran. Thank you for the offer, but it doesn't sit well with me.~
@450 = ~Excellent. Believe me, <CHARNAME>,  you won't regret it.~
@451 = ~Pity, a great pity indeed. But this is your choice, <CHARNAME>.~
@452 = ~(The conversation between you and Aran shifts back to generic topics, and then you part ways amicably. This conversation seems unlikely to lead to anything greater)~
@453 = ~It sounds very tempting. I agree, Master.~
@454 = ~Very good, <CHARNAME>, I did not doubt you for a moment. Be prepared then!~
@455 = ~Listen, Aran. I have joined the guild, and you are the head of the Guild, and your word is law. But, if I may voice my opinion, ruling a branch of the Shadow Guild is more than enough for me. I do have other unfinished business, you know.~
@456 = ~Spellhold? Of course. It's a great pity, <CHARNAME>, but of course I won't force you.~
@457 = ~(For a while Aran is silent, pouring wine for you, putting choice morsels onto your plate. And then you notice his intent gleaming gaze lingering on your face. The Shadow Master smiles)~
@458 = ~<CHARNAME>, you are indeed a valuable find for the Guild. I can't see you as just another Shadow Thief: you definitely stand head and shoulders above them. And so, please indulge my curiosity; why did you join us? ~
@459 = ~I can see you being interested in a career of a thief, but so far, you have been pursuing other goals, and your path, let me say frankly, is unique. So why?~
@460 = ~It would seem to me that you've envisioned a very different future for yourself, and your path, let me say frankly, is unique. So why?~
@461 = ~Your Guild opens the door to marvelous opportunities. Gold, power, adventure -- why would I refuse that?~
@462 = ~I find myself in a situation where I need support. And support from the Shadow Thieves is nothing to scoff at.~
@463 = ~I don’t know, Aran. I think it might be fate.~
@464 = ~(Laughing) Ah, fun and profit, fun and profit! This is indeed our way. You would make an excellent Shadow Thief even if you don't have to actually steal anything. But would you like to take a look at it from another angle? A little more... lofty, shall we say?~
@465 = ~Oh, do not doubt, you shall have it. Not unconditionally, of course, we aren’t a charity. But I would hope that our mutually advantageous collaboration would lead to... something larger. ~
@466 = ~Strange, isn’t it. Now that you’ve said it, I think you may be right. Not that I believe in fate... but I would want there to be more between us than just the Guild business.~
@467 = ~I am not quite getting your meaning, Aran... care to clarify?~
@468 = ~Your words aren’t too clear, but I think I like what you are saying.~
@469 = ~It seems to me that business collaboration is going to be enough.~
@470 = ~I don’t know myself yet. Friendship, perhaps? We’ll wait and see, I guess. But one thing I am certain about - you fascinate me.~
@471 = ~Is that so? I am happy to hear that. Perhaps this is a beginning of our... friendship, shall we say? I have to confess that you fascinate me quite a lot.~
@472 = ~Are you sure about that? We’ll wait and see, maybe you’ll change your mind some day. As for me, I would like to pursue a... friendship, shall we say? You fascinate me quite a lot.~
@473 = ~But I was under impression, for some reason, that the Shadow Master cannot afford to be burdened by friendship... or anything of the sort.~
@474 = ~An interesting notion. I will admit, it’s a risk, but if I were afraid of risk, I wouldn’t be what I am today. Do try the fruit, by the way. <CHARNAME>, we all revolve among others, people and creatures both like us and unlike us, and we have to enter different sorts of relationships, can’t avoid that. I say we are lucky to be on the same side. As much as I loathe thanking Bodhi for anything, but in this case I am forced to. ~
@475 = ~So let’s use fate’s gift wisely - after all, everything might have turned out very differently. And for now, let’s get to work - there are many things that need to be done urgently.~
@476 = ~(The conversation between you and Aran shifts back to generic topics, but you realize that from now on, there’s a tight bond between you and this man and the forces behind him. And it’s not yet clear where this is going to lead)~

// Group reactions to the prologue 
@4 = ~<CHARNAME>, is this really a letter from Aran Linvail, the head of the thieves guild? He's already given us a task, what else does he need?~
@5 = ~And why does he ask for you to come alone? That's strange.~
@6 = ~If you do go by yourself, be vigilant; this might be a trap!~
@7 = ~Why are you supposed to come alone? That’s kind of suspicious. I don't like this.~

// Episode 2. Encrypted message
@0 = ~My lady <CHARNAME>! My lady <CHARNAME>! Hello, I am Tony, remember me? You have a letter! You’ll know from whom.~
@1 = ~(The halfling scurries away, leaving you with the letter in your hands. You carefully open the envelope, take out a sheet of paper and start to read...)~
@2 = ~«Greetings, <CHARNAME>!  We need to meet for a chat. I am waiting for your visit at any time convenient for you, but please don’t take too long. Try to come alone. Aran Linvail.»~
@3 = ~Wonder what this means?~
@8 = ~(You are intrigued...)~
@9 = ~ Welcome, <CHARNAME>. I am glad you responded to my request, and I hope that our conversation will be... productive. Would you care for a glass of wine?~
@10 = ~Yes, thank you.~
@11 = ~No, thanks.~
@12 = ~(Aran pours you some wine. His manners are impeccable, and that makes you wonder what he might be trying to achieve)~
@13 = ~As you wish. In any case, let's sit down.~
@14 = ~Tell me, <CHARNAME>... As someone who grew up in Candlekeep, practically within the walls of the Great Library, you must have encountered mysterious books written in unknown languages or strange manuscripts that you attempted to decipher?~
@15 = ~(There is confidence and genuine interest in his gaze. You realize that the Shadow Master knows not only of your old fascination with ciphers and riddles -- he knows everything about you. This is slightly unsettling, but a well-known person like yourself should not have expected anything different from the Shadow Guild.)~
@16 = ~(You nod in response to Linvail's question)~
@17 = ~This is very good news. You wouldn't decline a request for help, I hope? I won't bore you with the story of how I got this letter and what happened to my previous code breaker. It's enough that I am very curious about what this little piece of paper says. Would you be so kind as to try and decipher it?~
@18 = ~(The Shadow Master is courteous and polite. A pleasant smile plays on his lips, but you realize that what he says is not a request but an order: there's no way to back out of this.)~
@19 = ~Yes, I will undertake this. How much time do I have?~
@20 = ~As much time as you need, but if you would, I would prefer that you start right now. This might be very important information. Make yourself comfortable. Nobody is going to bother you here.~
@21 = ~(You spend several hours aside from the document. Skills that you learned in the Candlekeep library are put to good use. Letter by letter, the meaning of the missive that you're holding in your hands becomes clear)~
@22 = ~(It is not signed, but judging by the context, it is addressed to somebody from the Order of the Radiant Heart. The addressee is ordered to use any means to stop the knights and the paladins from interfering in something that is going to happen in Athkatla. It looks like someone is planning a series of high profile murders)~
@23 = ~(You give the deciphered letter to Aran)~
@24 = ~It's ready? I thank you.~
@25 = ~You are not just quite attractive, <CHARNAME>, but without a doubt very smart.~
@26 = ~Let's see... oh, is this is how it is? Interesting... now they have gone too far.~
@27 = ~Who has gone too far?~
@28 = ~(Keep quiet and listen)~
@29 = ~Patience, my friend, patience. I will explain everything momentarily.~
@30 = ~Yes, <CHARNAME>, things are more serious than I expected.~
@31 = ~You have become a respected member of our guild so I can be frank with you. You realize that our organization is not a gathering of small-time thieves, nor a den of robbers. We are, my dear, in Athkatla, the City of Coin, where money rules and thievery reigns, be it in the streets or in the mansions, while gambling in taverns or signing huge contracts...~
@32 = ~In other words, without the Shadow Guild everything would descend into chaos?~
@33 = ~Just so. It may sound strange, but our power is a stabilizing factor. The Council and even the Order of the Radiant Heart understand this, and that is the reason they will never go to war with us.~
@34 = ~And you would have to be suicidal to start operating in Athkatla at night behind our backs. Suicidal, or... perhaps a spy. And I am not talking about that other guild now. Are you aware of the problems Amn is having with Riatavin these days?~
@35 = ~The town criers shout about them at every corner.~
@36 = ~Yes, and our adversaries conduct their business quietly.~
@37 = ~Of course. Riatavin wants to separate from Amn and become a part of Tethyr. And the situation is very tense right now.~
@38 = ~Yes, exactly this.~
@39 = ~I try to keep away from politics.~
@40 = ~Understandable. But I'm afraid it's not always feasible.~
@41 = ~We took this letter from a Riatavin courier. Unfortunately, he died before we could interrogate him. But one thing is clear: there is a foreign agent within the Order, perhaps more than one. Many of those holier-than-thou prudes are neck-deep in corruption. Well, I know what to do now. (Laughs) Who would have thought that I’d be working for the Most Noble Order, secretly cleansing it from taint!~
@42 = ~What kind of murders are the agents of Riatavin planning?~
@43 = ~From what I know, they plan to attack prominent merchants in charge of supplying the army. We aren’t going to let them. You know,  <CHARNAME>, no matter what they think, Athkatla is my city and I will not let anyone threaten it.~
@44 = ~(You expect the Shadow Master to say goodbye, but he is silent for a while. Then, he softly and gingerly strokes your cheek with the back of his palm...)~ [aransong]
@45 = ~You did excellently, <CHARNAME>. You are wonderful. You must be tired... how about we rest a bit?~
@46 = ~(Aran’s eyes are gleaming brightly. He look straight at you, and his gaze speaks louder than words. He smiles.)~
@47 = ~There are different ways to rest, aren’t there? The one I am suggesting will bring me much honor, and will bring you, I dare hope, much pleasure. You wouldn’t refuse me, would you, Bhaal’s daughter?~
@48 = ~(You take an abrupt step back) Bhaal’s daughter? You are interested in me because I am a demigod?~
@49 = ~But isn’t «demigod» an aspect of your being? This is you, as you are. And I am interested in everything that is included in «you».~
@50 = ~I won’t deny that I am also intrigued by the person behind the mysterious title of «Shadow Master».~
@51 = ~I am afraid I cannot reciprocate, Aran.~
@52 = ~Then perhaps we should try and get to know each other better? Starting right now.~
@53 = ~It saddens me to hear it. I don’t have a right to delay you then. I will call you when I need you again.~
@54 = ~Aran, I could steal your dagger from you. Why do you trust me?~
@55 = ~Remember, my darling, Shadow Master never trusts a person without a good reason. And what is happening between us is not a matter of trust but rather of... compatibility, shall we say? And I highly doubt that you’d be able to do that trick with the dagger. So what do you say we test... not your dexterity, but our compatibility?~
@56 = ~Oh yes, I am sure this test might prove... impressive.~
@57 = ~I am sorry, but no.~
@58 = ~To be with you... Why wouldn’t I, Aran? This is indeed a nice way to relax.~
@59 = ~Ahhh, my sweet darling...~
@60 = ~I appreciate the offer, Shadow Master. But still I would rest elsewhere.~
@61 = ~(Aran embraces you tenderly and kisses you, warmly, tentatively. You respond with joyful willingness, and soon the kisses become very different...)~
@62 = ~Was I perhaps too insistent? Forgive me. I am left with nothing but my regrets.~
@63 = ~(It looks like you are falling fast... Aran Linvail is an embodiment of a true Shadow Thief: he is swift and nimble, invisible and flamboyant at once. It seems time has no power over him, age makes no difference. You feel his powerful, insatiable will to live... and will to have, to have treasure, or the whole city, or a woman who caught his eye. Aran radiates an intoxicating feeling of danger, and that excites your divine blood. You are a dangerous being yourself, and it looks like you have met your match... Or not quite?)~
@64 = ~(When it’s all over, you don’t say anything. Aran walks you to the door in silence, and by the threshold lightly touches his lips to yours)~
@65 = ~Walk carefully, <CHARNAME>, and let shadows shelter you.~

// Group reactions (part 1)
@66 = ~You were away for a while, <CHARNAME>. Is everything alright?~
@67 = ~What did he want, <CHARNAME>? I've been waiting for so long!~ [JAHEIR23]
@68 = ~He asked me to decode an encrypted letter. It was an advanced code, so it took some time.~
@69 = ~It’s nothing, let’s go.~
@70 = ~That’s my private business, I don’t want to talk about it.~
@71 = ~<CHARNAME>, I have a lot of respect for you, but we are a team, so it would be better if the others knew what’s going on.~
@72 = ~Alright, we should be on our way. We've lost a lot of time as it is.~

// Episode 3. Messenger from Riatavin 
@73 = ~Hello, lady <CHARNAME>. You have another letter from you know who!~
@74 = ~«I would have liked this to be an invitation for another date, but alas, things stand a little different. I am waiting for you. Come without delay, if you can.»~
@75 = ~Here you are, my swift shadow. I am immensely happy to see you, <CHARNAME>.~
@76 = ~I am happy to see you too, Aran.~
@77 = ~Are you happy that I came when you called? Am I to become an obedient dagger in your guiding hand?~
@78 = ~(You give a polite half-bow in response)~
@79 = ~(He gives you a warm smile that, however, soon evaporates. Now you are looking at a leader, intense and full of energy)~
@80 = ~I will not require that of you. Not just yet, anyway. And while I appreciate your responsiveness, when I say I'm happy to see you, please take it at face value.~
@81 = ~Ah, so prim and proper! Should I take it to mean that you already regret our blissful relaxation? But anyway, this is not what I would like to talk about.~
@82 = ~Alas, <CHARNAME>, as much as I would like there to be another reason, we'll have to talk business first.~
@83 = ~I learned that a courier from Riatavin is waiting to meet his connection by the City Gates to get the latest brief. He will wait in vain: we took care of it. But we want Riatavin to think that things are going as planned for a while longer.~
@84 = ~We are going to send them a counterfeit missive. And I need to use your talents again; this time you will have to write a letter using the same code that you broke so brilliantly the last time. Here, <CHARNAME>, this is the text I prepared.~
@85 = ~This is going to be interesting. And you know, Shadow Master, I enjoy working by your side.~
@86 = ~Do you want me to do the task in your chambers as before? With the same reward as before?~
@87 = ~Very well, then I should promptly start working.~
@88 = ~Believe it or not, this is reciprocated. My darling <CHARNAME>, I have had smart and clever associates before you, but never have I... but let's not digress.~
@89 = ~How do you thinking what I'm thinking? If so then I'm flattered that you would see it as a reward. Although I would rather treat it as an exchange of gifts. But we digress again.~
@90 = ~(Aran nods in agreement)~
@91 = ~(You handle the code with ease, creating a false report to be passed to Riatavin. Aran is very pleased and expresses his pleasure in an affectionate but uninsistent way. You part ways.)~
@92 = ~(You handle the code with ease, creating a false report to be passed to Riatavin. Aran is very pleased and expresses his pleasure by kissing you. You feel that you're getting used to these casual kisses, light and ephemeral like a touch of a butterfly's wing. You're getting used to Aran as well. But do you like the way your relationship is heading or not?)~
@93 = ~Aran, should I give the fake report to the courier myself?~
@94 = ~That was not something I planned, but... why not? Tonight, in the hotel by the City Gates; the password is "Tethyr and Nightingale". You should exchange messages. This is not a hard test but still, be very careful. I would regret losing you, <CHARNAME>.~
@95 = ~(You see a man standing  by himself) Hey, what are you looking for?~
@96 = ~Tethyr and Nightingale.~
@97 = ~Athkatla and Falcon.~
@98 = ~Raven on the Sword Coast.~
@99 = ~Quite the weather we are having today...~
@100 = ~Crown and Riatavin! I've been waiting here for a long time. Here you go, milady. (gives you a sealed package)~
@101 = ~(Say nothing and give him the missive)~
@102 = ~Anything new about the Shadow Thieves?~
@103 = ~Thank you, milady, and good luck.~
@104 = ~I don't know what the package says, and we are not supposed to share anything verbally. But you know, our people keep stirring the pot to give the Shadowmaster a headache. But you be careful at any rate, if that Linvail gets his hands on you... he might not give such a woman to an executioner, but he'll surely make you drink poison or something...~
@105 = ~Um... thanks? I will be careful. I have to go now.~
@106 = ~Good luck, milady.~
@107 = ~What? Lady, are you making fun of me or...~
@108 = ~I'm sorry, milady, I've no time to chat.~
@109 = ~(Looking at the Shadow Master, you realize that he is glad to see you again. Aran doesn't let it show, but there is a certain gleam in his eye.)~
@110 = ~I have a gift for you, O Shadow Master, but there is a matter of a little ransom.~
@111 = ~Impertinence! (Now the spark his eyes becomes... dangerous? In the blink of an eye your wrist is seized in the vise-like grip of Linvail's hand, and your trophy is removed)~
@112 = ~Maybe you, little shadow lover, will have to pay ransom for your freedom now?~ [aransong]
@113 = ~(Your silently stare into his beautiful, sly eyes. He slowly relaxes his grip and almost worshipfully lifts your hand to his lips)~
@114 = ~It's good that you came back, <CHARNAME>...~
@115 = ~(You kiss Aran, and he kisses you back with gusto. He exudes soft, contained power. Warm touches of his slender, limber hands make you dizzy. It looks like the two of you are in for several delightful hours together...)~
@116 = ~It's easier to escape from any prison, <CHARNAME>, than it is to tear myself from you. But my work won't finish itself, and I unfortunately have plenty of that.~
@117 = ~Work... Aran, I so much want to hide in shadows with you, hide from the whole world, forget about Irenicus, about Bhaal, about everything.~
@118 = ~We've had a wonderful rest, so we can get back to work refreshed and renewed.~
@119 = ~That would be nice. No, that would be wonderful! Perhaps one day, my darling, we are going to do just that.~
@120 = ~(Smiles) Is that how you view it? Works for me. I am not sure I can always be on hand when you desire to rest, but let me know and I will do what I can.~
@121 = ~Aran. I am grateful to you. But don't you think this is where it ends? You are the Shadow Master, I am a daughter of the Lord of Murder... is it ours to think of being... more? We should stop while we can remember each other without bitterness.~
@122 = ~(Darkly) I was not expecting to hear something like that from you, <CHARNAME>. You, brave and daring like... a Shadow Thief, are afraid of love? This is your right, of course; I will not ask or insist. Thank you for being with me. And now, as I said, we should get back to work.~
@123 = ~Yes, I already know what happened. Any one of us can get unlucky, of course, but, truth be told, I expected better of you.~
@124 = ~(Suddenly you feel playful. You hide the package you got from the courier behind your back)~
@125 = ~(He looks at you expectantly)~

// Episode 4. Mysterious Stranger
@126 = ~(You leave the headquarters of the Guild, recollecting and reliving in your mind everything that went on between you and the Shadow Master. Suddenly, you feel strangely alarmed)~
@127 = ~(You notice that someone is watching you intently, trying to stay undetected. Then you see that someone slipping in front of you. It is a beautiful dark-haired woman wearing a mage's robes. It seems you've seen her somewhere. She proceeds towards the Bridge District.)~
@128 = ~My lady <CHARNAME>! Have you seen her?~
@129 = ~I haven't seen anyone, Tony. But I felt someone's presence nearby...~
@130 = ~There was a woman mage! Pretty, with black hair. I think she's related to somebody from the Guild. She went towards the Bridge.~
@131 = ~Oh, you again! I am sorry, I stared at you so intently back at the Guild, I must have made you uneasy.~
@132 = ~What did you have to hide?~
@133 = ~Oh, the Docks are always full of such rough people. All that rowdy catcalling... but I was there to visit a relative. He is also a Shadow Thief, and he told me about you -- you are an impressive person, you know. But listen, this is a tavern, and I came here to relax a bit...~
@134 = ~How about a glass of wine to celebrate our acquaintance? (She produces a bottle of red wine seemingly out of nowhere, as if by magic)~
@135 = ~(After briefly examining the wine, you recognize that it is poisoned). This is a fascinating proposal, but why are you trying to murder me?~
@136 = ~So that's how it is. Linvail's little puppet noticed something strange, didn't she? All right then. You are in my way. Is that explanation enough? It's a pity; I wanted this to go quietly. I will have to resort to magic now.~
@137 = ~(While pretending to sip from the offered goblet, you glance at the strange woman's face and see that she is tense, as if anxiously waiting for something. You drop the goblet and in the same movement place your sharp dagger against the woman's neck)~
@138 = ~And now you will tell me whom you are working for.~
@139 = ~Ah! Damn you! The boys from Riatavin Hired me so I could get to Linvail through my brother. But you are always hovering about him!~
@140 = ~So what were you going to do? (You press the blade against her neck a bit harder)~
@141 = ~In broad terms, first replace you in Aran's arms, and then bump him off. There was a time when he looked at me quite favorably...~
@142 = ~That is disgusting! So Riatavin is trying to infiltrate our Guild?~
@143 = ~It appears to be so. But please, put your weapon down. I swear on my son's life I will leave Amn immediately. And I will never come close to your Aran, or indeed any one of you. I swear.~
@144 = ~What is your name?~
@145 = ~My name is Leena. The Shadow Master knows me, as I said, and I will have to go to some lengths to hide from him, but at least I will live... I beg you, for my son's sake!~
@146 = ~I might be making a mistake, but get out. Now!~
@147 = ~Oh, you are too kind for a Shadow Thief, but you won't regret it, I promise.~
@148 = ~This will not fly. You were going to kill Aran... and I love him. (Cut her throat)~
@149 = ~You think I'm going to buy this? Try again.~
@150 = ~All right, I will tell you more, I will name names... just please spare my life!~
@151 = ~You will tell me more? I will agree to that. But you will do that in the Guild.~
@152 = ~Linvail is going to kill me...~
@153 = ~Folks, why don't you step outside for a while. Leave us alone.~
@155 = ~(Thinking about what all of this might mean, you absentmindedly accept a goblet from the stranger's hands and take a swallow...)~
@156 = ~To Bhaal with your wine!  You spy on me, and then offer me a drink out of the blue? Do I really look this stupid?~
@157 = ~(Her face contorts with anger) Do you want to know the truth? You are in my way. You always hang around Linvail and prevent me from approaching him. When you are gone, I will take your place in his bed, little girl.~
@158 = ~Are you in love with Aran?~
@159 = ~Are you planning to kill Aran?~
@160 = ~Does it really matter? You are going to meet your gods one way or the other, and soon. I did not want to resort to magic but you are forcing my hand...~
@161 = ~My people already told me what happened. This is rather unpleasant... I know Leena, and I have never thought that she would betray me and lead her brother astray... or was it vice versa? This is something I need to figure out.~
@162 = ~I don't think you should have spared her life. Of course we are going to find her. But what you did was reckless.~
@163 = ~Listen. She mentioned having a son. Alas, sometimes evil people make you follow their orders using your children to blackmail you. I just couldn't... I'm sorry. Have I disappointed you?~
@164 = ~(Aran is silent for a moment). I understand your feelings better than you think. You have no children, and I know what it is like to worry about your child. And now when I think about her... forget about this, <CHARNAME>. My boys will take care of the traitor. And I am grateful to you for averting this menace. Although if that... If Leena managed to kill you, she would have to find another way to get close to me. After you... no, I could never.~
@165 = ~(He embraces you on the spur of the moment)~
@166 = ~Now we must part for a while, <CHARNAME>. Rest, my friend. You have deserved a reward, while I, as you see, acquired more trouble.~
@167 = ~This miserable traitor has a child... listen, Aran... I am leaving a trail of dead bodies behind me all the way from Candlekeep, and I am growing tired of it. Don't know why now, of all time, but I couldn't make myself kill this woman. They most likely blackmailed her, using her child. Are you disappointed in me?~
@168 = ~No, I'm not. I was not planning to use you as an assassin; I have other people for that. But your dark legacy, <CHARNAME>, is a serious reason to worry. I can feel that something is tearing you up inside. And I would like to help if I knew how.~
@169 = ~In any case, I am grateful to you for averting this menace. Although if that... If Leena managed to kill you, she would have to find another way to get close to me. After you... no, I could never.~
@170 = ~(You feel a wave of bitterness and exhaustion roll over you. All you want right now is to be left alone and never involve yourself in anything like this again.)~
@171 = ~I'm sorry Aran, this is probably my mistake. Will you punish me for it?~
@172 = ~Oh, do be sensible, my girl! I trust you and your choices, and if anything goes wrong, we will set it right. Go get some rest.~
@173 = ~May I ask you not to be too severe with her? Maybe try to figure out what made her a traitor? It is very possible they used her son to blackmail her.~
@174 = ~I am not the soulless killer many people make me out to be. I promise to investigate everything thoroughly and give her exactly what she deserves, no more, no less. But it does bother me a little that you would defend somebody who planned my murder?~
@175 = ~Aran, it was not her who planned the murder, but the Riatavin agents behind her. And I will do anything you tell me to do in order to eliminate them all!~
@176 = ~(Laughing) Oh, such fire! I love it when you are... like that.~
@177 = ~Rip every little detail out of them, make them confess everything they've ever done, whatever it takes!~
@178 = ~ I am not the soulless killer many people make me out to be. I promise to investigate everything thoroughly and give her exactly what she deserves, no more, no less. But aren't you bloodthirsty all of a sudden?~
@179 = ~What did you expect? They planned to murder you! And I feel that I could tear out anyone's throat for you, Shadow Master.~
@180 = ~To be honest, I did not expect to hear something like that from you. Is this... loyalty? please tell me it's not just that. Although probably not right now.~
@181 = ~It's good that this woman is dead. Although in this case, I would probably prefer if you didn't act in such a straightforward manner.~
@182 = ~You are displeased that I killed the wretch who wanted to murder you?~
@183 = ~I would not put it like that. I don't think you really had a choice. In any case, you protected me, and you know, I am pleased that it was you who did that.~
@184 = ~Let's give her body to the necromancers, let them raise her and have a chat. Maybe she will tell them something interesting.~
@185 = ~(Aran lets out a surprised laugh) Now that is quite an idea! You know, my darling, I am starting to be afraid of you just a little...~
@186 = ~Why not? Let's drink.~
@187 = ~Please! No!~
@188 = ~Both this wretch and her brother will be thoroughly interrogated. But this is not your concern, <CHARNAME>.~

// Episode 5. 'Yes' or 'No'
@189 = ~Mistress <CHARNAME>! Uh... you know. ~
@190 = ~"This time it's just a date. No more. But no less. I'm really looking forward to it. "~
@191 = ~(A pleasant warmth spreads in my chest. Are you sure you want to go on this date?) ~
@192 = ~(You're not sure if you want to go, but you're curious what Aran has to say this time) ~
@193 = ~(Thinking carefully, you realize that your relationship with Aran Linvail has gone too far. You are not going to go to this meeting) ~
@194 = ~(You are immersed in the most romantic atmosphere you can imagine - the fragrance of lush flowers, the sparkle of precious glasses in the glow of candles, magic lights circling overhead... Luxury that does not cross over into bad taste. Aran is dressed simply but elegantly. He smiles pleasantly, and you see in front of you not the head of the guild in which you are a member, but a man in love with you) ~ [aransong]
@195 = ~It sounds trite, but I was afraid you wouldn't come. ~
@196 = ~I'm here. And I would like to talk to you, Aran. ~
@197 = ~Of course, <CHARNAME>, I'm listening to you. ~
@198 = ~I had no peace in my soul anyway, but now... Aran, we allowed ourselves to be too close. It would have been much easier if it had stayed as part of an easy affair. ~
@199 = ~But this is not an easy affair. I love you <CHARNAME>. ~
@200 = ~Maybe it isn't the right time. Maybe I shouldn't have... But I can't hold back anymore. Aran, I needed to come. I wanted to come. ~
@201 = ~My <CHARNAME>... I've been waiting for this. I expected such words from you. Can I finally say that I love you? ~
@202 = ~When I came to see you now, I thought a lot. It hurts me. But we have to stop all this. Trust me, it's better this way. ~
@203 = ~(Aran smiles sadly). Does it hurt? .. You don't know how it hurts me now. But let's at least have a glass of wine - and we'll part beautifully. I will try to make sure that we meet as little as possible on guild matters. I promise, <CHARNAME>. And I hope that someday your soul will find serenity. ~
@204 = ~You love me... But I am Bhaal's daughter. Does this mean something to you? ~
@205 = ~Yes and no. Your dark, dangerous, unexplored side certainly attracts me. So does your strength. But there is death in it - and I love life. And having got to know you better, I realized that life is you, yourself, in spite of your heritage. Do you understand? This is what I love in you... No, not in you. You! Let me explain myself better than words... ~
@206 = ~(You have never felt so good with Aran as you do now... You stroke his shoulder, feeling the most conflicting feelings overwhelm you) ~
@207 = ~I guess now I can say that I love you too... Yes, Aran. ~
@208 = ~But you know I'm going to find Irenicus, and that's not something to just brush aside... Are you ready to put me down? ~
@209 = ~But you know I need to find Imoen. I cannot betray her. Are you ready to put me down? ~
@210 = ~But you know my business with damned Irenicus isn't over yet. Otherwise, I simply have no future. Are you ready to put me down? ~
@211 = ~I have no right to hold you back, <CHARNAME>. But promise you'll come back. You will not just return to Athkatla. To me. ~
@212 = ~(For some reason, you suddenly clearly realize that your relationship has come to a point. Now you have to take a decisive step. "Yes" or "no" will determine your fate) ~
@213 = ~Yes, Aran. I will come back to you. I'll stay with you. ~
@214 = ~I want to return to you, Aran, but I can't promise anything. After all, we have no power over the future. Let's just enjoy what we have now! ~
@215 = ~(For the first time, you see how the face of someone who is used to commanding the shadows is illuminated by an inner light. Aran hugs you tighter and says two words: "I am happy") ~
@216 = ~(Aran chuckles) Yes, this is probably the wisest thing we can do, my little <CHARNAME>. Just enjoy - without worries, without hesitation, without thinking about the future. It suits me. Kiss me... ~
@217 = ~(You try to banish thoughts of him so that this will stay all in the past) ~
@218 = ~(You mentally prepare yourself for the upcoming meeting with the Shadow Master...) ~
@219 = ~(You finish your wine and say goodbye sadly. You will try to forget it...) ~

// Greetings (part 1)
@220 = ~Hello <CHARNAME>. It's always nice to see you again.~
@221 = ~Hello my favorite Shadow Thief. ~

// Group reactions (part 2)
@222 = ~<CHARNAME>, I understand that for the sake of saving Imoen, you can reluctantly choose the lesser of evils and provide some services to the Shadow Thieves, but it seems to me that you have tied yourself too closely to them. Am I right? ~
@223 = ~<CHARNAME>, I understand that to fight that evil mage, you can reluctantly choose the lesser of evils and provide some services to the Shadow Thieves, but it seems to me that you have tied yourself too closely to them. Am I right? ~
@224 = ~You're right, Keldorn. I joined the ranks of the Shadow Thieves and I have no regrets about it. ~
@225 = ~We each have our own path, Sir Keldorn. Not everyone becomes a paladin. ~
@226 = ~If you look at it, the Shadow Guild is no worse than the Order of the Radiant Heart. You can hide behind bright ideals, but still everything rests on one thing - power. ~
@227 = ~Are you sure we really need to continue this conversation? You are my friend, and I don't want to quarrel with you. ~
@228 = ~Keldorn, if you want to stay with me any longer, you'll have to come to terms with the fact that I won't give you an account of my actions. ~
@229 = ~(Sighs) <CHARNAME>, although you grew up among people who neglected the fuss and temptations of life, many important things are not understood by you. You hardly realize what the path of the paladin is. So don't judge it. ~
@230 = ~For all your wisdom, Keldorn, you too are unlikely to understand that sometimes the shadow is not as black as it seems. We see the world too differently. ~
@231 = ~I can understand much more than you think, <CHARNAME>, for I've seen a lot. But I will not stay by your side if you harm the innocent. Remember this. ~
@232 = ~Now that I better understand the customs of the surfacers, I think, abbil, that you cannot keep a man accustomed to rule in check. Although, it must have been very interesting to tame such a male... In any case, I like your choice, for you have joined a strong side. ~ [VICONI07]
@233 = ~(Viconia hisses a quiet curse and jostles your elbow, causing the goblet to fall and shatter) ~
@234 = ~Light blind you, <CHARNAME>! Are you daft? You don't swill down anything a stranger offers, not without checking it first! ~ [VICONI04]
@235 = ~(Shudders, seeing a drow's black face under the hood) Aaaah! ~
@236 = ~Do you see how nervous this pitiful surface creature is? Kill her, <CHARNAME>! ~ [VICONI27]

// Group Reactions (Romance Conflicts Part 1)
@237 = ~(Anomen looks at you intently, as if he wants to read something in your soul) ~
@238 = ~My lady... Maybe these are my fantasies... fears... that don't make any sense. But it seems to me that your secret dealings with your guild leader are more than just inspiring. Your eyes shine when you return from him! I guess I'm wrong, but still... ~
@239 = ~(He hesitates, hesitating to say what he thinks aloud) ~
@240 = ~(You feel a painful prick of conscience. Aran and Anomen are so different that you have no trouble bestowing your feelings on both. Of course, this cannot last long. But if you tell Anomen the truth, he will end the relationship, and you are not yet ready for this choice. ) ~
@241 = ~(False) Sorry, Anomen, but I don't understand what you're talking about. ~
@242 = ~Really? (Sighs heavily) Should I be satisfied with this answer? Well, so be it. ~ [ANOMEN28]
@243 = ~(Anomen, of course, is right. You are seriously carried away by the Shadow Master, and it turns out, you can even read it on your face. It makes no sense to continue dating two men - Anomen must find out the truth) ~
@244 = ~Anomen, I'm sorry... But this is not a fantasy. I am really close to Aran Linvail. ~
@245 = ~(An unkind light flashes in Anomen's eyes as he grabs his weapon in rage) ~
@246 = ~So it's true! You... you chose this rogue over me! And I... I believed you so! You know what I'm going to do... ~
@247 = ~(Interrupts him) You won't do anything, Anomen. I didn't lie to you when I responded to your feelings, but now everything has changed. It's really hard for me to hurt you, but you can't command my heart, and I don't want to lie to you. Sorry. But there are things you just need to accept. ~
@248 = ~You don't have to explain. All I've been doing lately is taking the blows that come my way. It's not going well, you know... My whole life has been a mess! First I was expelled from the Order, and now I have to leave you, too. ~
@249 = ~No, Anomen. You don't have to leave. The end of a relationship is not the end of everything, believe me. ~
@250 = ~(Chuckling sadly) I see, you need a priest and a warrior nearby. I have nowhere to go now. Well, good. I'll try to just forget about what happened between us. Now leave me. ~ [ANOMEN28]
@251 = ~(Anomen looks at you in silence. When he finally speaks, he seems to be struggling to speak): So what should I do now, <CHARNAME>? Challenge this scoundrel to a knightly duel to fight him for your heart? Oh Helm, what nonsense... ~
@252 = ~Of course it's nonsense. I wasn't lying, I still have the warmest feelings for you. But you know, even if I hadn't loved Aran, our paths would have parted sooner or later. You are a knight and I am a Shadow Thief. It would have been harder and harder for us to understand each other. ~
@253 = ~There is a grain of truth in what you say. That's what's holding me back now, because... because it is very hard for me to hold back. But I'll do it. And I'll stay with you as long as you need my help. After all, you supported me and helped me achieve my dream. I'll try to remain your friend. What else could I do? ~
@254 = ~(You again notice that heavy, appraising look in Anomen's, betraying the agony of his doubts. You realize that it's time to finally explain yourself) ~
@255 = ~Anomen... I have something very important to tell you, which can be quite painful for you... ~
@256 = ~Don't, I know! It's Linvail, isn't it? Have you fallen for him? ~
@257 = ~Yes, I love Aran. Sorry, but that's it. ~
@258 = ~(Rasaad does not take his eyes off you, his eyes are uncertain and worried. Finally he speaks to you...) ~
@259 = ~<CHARNAME>... listen... I have doubts, can you confirm or dispel them? For some reason, it seems to me that you are attracted to this guild not only by excitement... ~
@260 = ~(You feel a painful prick of conscience. Aran and Rasaad are so different that you have no trouble bestowing your feelings on both. Of course, this cannot last long. But if you tell Rasaad the truth, then your relationship is over, and you are not yet ready for this choice.) ~
@261 = ~(False) I don't understand you, Rasaad. ~
@262 = ~Don't you understand? Maybe you do, and you're probably just not ready to explain right now. So let's leave it at that. ~
@263 = ~(Rasaad, of course, is right. You are seriously carried away by the Shadow Master, and it turns out that he can even read it on your face. There is no point in continuing to date two men - Rasaad must find out the truth) ~
@264 = ~Sorry Rasaad, but you're not wrong. I'm glad to have joined the Shadow Thieves, but I'm even more excited to have Aran Linvail in my life. ~
@265 = ~(Rasaad is silent for a long time) I loved you very much, <CHARNAME>. I still love you... It was difficult for me to accept the fact that you joined a guild in which bad deeds are happening, but this does not compare with how I feel now. ~
@266 = ~Rasaad, you are one of those who seek light in the dark even if it never shines there. Don't be fooled about me. I found my way; it is shrouded in shadow, but it is mine. ~
@267 = ~I understand. Your love shone for me like the moon in the night sky, but it was covered by a shadow... And I am powerless to change anything. I'll just try not to drown my mind in this bitterness... Love is beyond reason, but the main thing is that you don't make a mistake. ~
@268 = ~I'm confident in my feelings, Rasaad. I love Aran. ~
@269 = ~I'm not just talking about love, <CHARNAME>... But so be it. It's good that you told me the truth. I'll try... to overcome this. ~
@270 = ~We're going to make it. I am sure we will remain close friends. ~
@271 = ~I really hope so. Now, I need to be alone... ~ [OH86747]
@272 = ~(Rasaad is thoughtful and sad, and he avoids your gaze. He seems to have no doubts that you prefer someone else to him. You know it's time to finally explain)~
@273 = ~Rasaad, I... it's hard for me to talk about this... ~
@274 = ~<CHARNAME>, if it's hard, it's not worth it. I understood everything. ~ [OH86728]

@281 = ~(Though it's hard for you to hide your feelings, you shouldn't flaunt them when dealing with the Shadow Master, even though they're no longer a secret to anyone. So you and Aran hold back, playing for other people's ears and eyes, and only your glances tell a different story...) ~
@282 = ~Ah... you're back, and I'm overjoyed! And you're back even sooner than I expected. I don't need to ask how the journey went, do I? Honestly, I had some concerns... ~
@283 = ~Actually, my return was in question... considering that your captain betrayed me. ~
@284 = ~Fears, you say? Anyone else in my place would ask if Saemon Havarian betrayed me at your instructions... ~

// Episode 6. Heart of Bodhi
@286 = ~(Bodhi's black heart is in your hands. You feel it throbbing, making your fingers tremble and creating the involuntary fear that the mighty vampire is about to rise again and laugh at your victory. But minutes pass and nothing happens. Gradually the fear fades and you are overcome with jubilation - one of your enemies is finally defeated! Now you look at Bodhi's heart with triumph, like a trophy won in a long and grueling struggle.) ~
@287 = ~(You decide to take this heart to Aran) ~
@288 = ~You are back, <CHARNAME>... (Aran pulls you close and kisses you warmly). And we're finally alone! ~ [aransong]
@289 = ~(For a while, you express the joy of meeting like all lovers, not with words. But when you finally break away from each other, you remember the trophy in your bag) ~
@290 = ~Aran, I have a present for you. Take it, it's the heart of Bodhi. No more will this filthy creature spoil our lives. ~
@291 = ~Bodhi is dead... - (Aran takes the black heart from your hands with apprehension, as if it is saturated with poison). - Finally! How much trouble has she caused, how many people have I lost because of her...? Oh, my <CHARNAME>, if not for you, this would have gone on for a long time. Whether you like it or not, your strength leads you forward, and you will surely deal with your enemies. ~
@292 = ~(Aran gazes intently at the icy piece of once living flesh, his eyes narrow, as if he wants to understand, to see more...) ~
@293 = ~She was once an elf... But the elven essence was taken from her and Irenicus as punishment. No, I'm not going to pity them at all, I just can't imagine what I would do in their place... But I'm already losing myself... terrible things are happening to me. ~
@294 = ~She was once an elf... just like me. No, I don't pity her. I just don't know what I would do if they took my elven essence from me, and they did exactly that to Bodhi and Irenicus - as a punishment. But I'm already losing myself... terrible things are happening to me. ~
@295 = ~Tell me. Only... - (Aran hardly looks away from Bodhi's heart, as if it bewitches him with something). "Let me get rid of this trophy first. Believe me, this is your only gift that will suffer such a fate... ~
@296 = ~(The Shadow Master walks to the fireplace and throws a black heart into the fire - it burns faster than expected. Aran sighs in relief) ~
@297 = ~Now that's really it. But... what's wrong with you? <CHARNAME>? Are you shaking? ~
@298 = ~(Continuing the conversation that you yourself started, you remember your transformation into the Slayer, there, in Spellhold. Memory helpfully draws the details - pain and confusion when you woke up, realizing that something impossible had happened, horror on the faces of your comrades , fear for yourself and for them...) ~
@299 = ~(Yes, you're in control of your uncanny ability now, but you can no longer vouch for yourself. You suddenly imagine falling asleep in Aran's arms and waking up as a cursed spawn of Bhaal - to feel nothing but lust for murder as you tear your lover to pieces... You shudder and your eyes fill with tears.) ~
@300 = ~(Aran squeezes your shoulders tightly, looking into your eyes. "What's wrong with you?" - he repeats the question. "Tell me," he says, sounding more like a demand than a request, but you're not going to dodge the question.) ~
@301 = ~This is the power you spoke of. I am dangerous now, Aran. I am more dangerous to you than Bodhi. ~
@302 = ~Aran... ...what if this had happened while you were around? The thought of what I could have done to you makes me sick... ~
@303 = ~You must be disgusted now that you realize what a daughter of Bhaal truly is? If you want to leave... tell me. I will understand. ~
@304 = ~I've always known you were dangerous, <CHARNAME>, since we first met. Although, of course, I did not expect this exactly. But you know, you're talking to the Shadow Master. Living on the brink of risk, walking on the edge of a knife is my style. ~
@305 = ~Yes, you may be my biggest risk right now. But you're also my greatest love, don't forget. And I will never leave you. It only hurts me to see you suffer. ~
@306 = ~You would have killed me, <CHARNAME>. Worst of all, you might not have forgiven yourself afterwards. But we are still alive! That's all that matters. ~
@307 = ~Yes, you may be my biggest risk right now. But you're also my greatest love, don't forget. And I will never leave you. It only hurts me to see you suffer. ~
@308 = ~What nonsense are you talking about, my girl? I just don't recognize you. ~
@309 = ~I can't go on living like this, with such a legacy, with such a load... something is bound to happen. But, Aran, your words... - (Unable to explain how you feel now, you hug Aran again, expressing everything that you cannot say. In response, he kisses the tears from your eyes) ~
@310 = ~I'll tell you this, my darling... Anything can happen, but for now we're safe and sound and celebrating victory. So let's celebrate it our way! I've missed being close to you terribly, and I hope it's mutual. You and me, there's nothing else... no one else... Kiss me, <CHARNAME>. ~

@349 = ~<CHARNAME>, I have a suspicion that one of our best thieves, the half elf Wispin, has sold out to the Order of the Radiant Heart. Those simpletons who think this order is truly noble would be unpleasantly surprised to learn that the saints are not squeamish about our methods. Of course, these gentlemen paladins would love to know what sort of thing we're cooking up. But we must act carefully - prelate Vessalen is a worthy opponent. I will invite Vispin to my place. Join us at the table and take a closer look at him. I'm interested in your opinion. ~
@350 = ~(Over a glass of wine, you talk to Wispin a lot, asking cautious questions about his life, thief's ways, and religious beliefs. You soon begin to notice some ambiguities and contradictions in his answers. Certainly the half-elf is hiding something) ~
@351 = ~(When Wispin leaves, you share your observations with Aran) ~
@352 = ~Great job, <CHARNAME>. It seemed to me that he was about to open up. I was not mistaken, we need to keep him under surveillance. ~
@353 = ~(Smiling charmingly at Vispin, you make toast after toast, plying him with wine. Unable to resist your charm, he loses his vigilance and speaks up a couple of times in response to your unobtrusive questions. It seems like he really has something to do with the paladins from the Order of the Radiant Heart) ~
@354 = ~Yes, that was something... I was getting jealous, honestly. Thank you <CHARNAME>, though my heart feels heavy... are you a thief or a witch? ~
@355 = ~(When you talk to Wispin at the table, you talk a lot about Candlekeep, about the monks who inhabit it, and about the paladins who often stay within its walls. Baffled by your skillfully posed questions, Wispin demonstrates much more knowledge of spiritual matters than one would expect. It means little in itself, but you get an intuitive feeling that he is a secret religious convert, maybe even a fanatic.) ~
@356 = ~I'm sure you're not mistaken. Now I can assume with even greater confidence that this guy is playing a double game. Thank you. My guys won't take their eyes off him. ~
@357 = ~(You have a pleasant conversation with Wispin at the table, and you manage to draw his attention away. Taking advantage of the moment, you deftly pull the paper you've long since spotted sticking out of his pocket. You apologize, give an excusem and leave for a while to look at the stolen letter. When you return, you return it to the owner just as discreetly.) ~
@358 = ~(When Wispin leaves, you tell Aran the contents of a letter to Wispin from his spiritual advisor - the half-elf has recently converted to Torm) ~
@359 = ~Oh <CHARNAME>, few can compare to your dexterity. So, a follower of the paladin god is in our ranks? I was not mistaken in my suspicions. Now, I have to think about how to turn this situation to our favor. ~
@360 = ~(You chat at the table with the half elf Wispin for a long time, but you notice nothing strange about him. When he leaves, you are discouraged. You admit to Aran that you have nothing to tell him.) ~
@361 = ~Pity. Well, it doesn't always work out the way we want it to. We'll keep an eye on him. ~
@362 = ~(Just look at Aran) ~
@580 = ~(Kiss Aran) ~
@363 = ~(You are overwhelmed by feelings too powerful for words. You can't and don't want to say anything now - your gaze will say more than words.) ~
@364 = ~(Aran seems to understand your feelings perfectly well. The two of you are silent for a long time before he takes your hand, intertwining your fingers with his...) ~
@365 = ~(You will never forget the taste of these lips. But now you don't just remember it, you feel it again with pleasure - and this is the brightest joy in your life full of darkness and trials) ~
@366 = ~(Your kisses last a long time... maybe this is a prelude to something bigger?) ~
@367 = ~(Give Aran a flower) ~
@368 = ~(With a smile, you hand the Shadow Master a flower - a simple daisy picked from one of the flower beds in the Government District) ~
@369 = ~(Aran, with a cunning look in his eyes, accepts your modest gift. Suddenly, a luxurious orchid is in his hand, which he presents to you) ~
@370 = ~Two sentimental Thieves! We thought the same thing. ~
@371 = ~Aran, my joy... ~
@372 = ~*Linvail gently pulls you towards him*~
@373 = ~No matter what, there is so much tenderness in you, <CHARNAME>... With you, I feel like I'm in another world. ~
@374 = ~I love you, Aran! ~
@375 = ~You know my answer, but I'm happy to say it again: I love you too. ~
@376 = ~Let me see... ~
@377 = ~May the shadow of the enemy keep you, <CHARNAME>. ~
@378 = ~About that traitor story... ~
@379 = ~So... Bodhi is finally dead, right? I am very satisfied. Finally, Shadow Thieves can breathe a sigh of relief. You did your best, <CHARNAME>. ~

// Loss of the guild
@380 = ~Mistress <CHARNAME>! It's me again. A little message for you. ~
@381 = ~"So you no longer have your guild. Do you know why this happened, <CHARNAME>? You went about your business the wrong way. It seems that no one taught you the art of management. I can explain your mistakes to you when we meet, but it doesn't burn. You are still a Shadow Thief, and there will always be something more suitable for you to do. Don't even think about relaxing. Aran "~

// Group reactions (part 3)
@382 = ~<CHARNAME>... c-can I talk to you? ~ [AERIE33]
@383 = ~Of course, I'm always happy to talk to you Aerie. ~
@384 = ~Thanks... I th-think you're a very good friend. That's why I decided to have this conversation... about you. ~
@385 = ~Do you want to talk to me about your wings? ~
@386 = ~W-What? No! No, <CHARNAME>, it is in vain that you think that I am incapable of thinking about anything but my troubles. I wanted to talk about you. ~
@387 = ~Aerie, maybe another time? ~
@388 = ~I... sorry, p-please. Perhaps the best thing for me would be to keep quiet... Yes. ~ [AERIE30]
@389 = ~About me? ~
@390 = ~Yes... or rather, about you and this man, Aran Linvail. ~
@391 = ~Aerie, this is somewhat... unexpected. ~
@392 = ~Yes, I understand that, <CHARNAME>. But I just can't keep quiet... I'm worried about you. ~
@393 = ~About Aran? Are you also partial to him?~
@394 = ~(blushes) W-why would you say that, <CHARNAME>? I have no interest in him. I mean, I wouldn't if I wasn't worried about you. ~
@395 = ~Oh, I can talk to anyone about Aran. ~
@396 = ~Do you like him that much? But l-listen... that's what makes me worry. ~
@397 = ~I don't quite understand, Aerie, why you'd be worried all of a sudden. ~
@398 = ~Thank you. But, really, there's nothing to worry about. Aran and I are fine together. ~
@399 = ~I don't feel like talking to you about my private affairs. ~
@401 = ~Aran Linvail... he is in a position that raises concerns. Do you understand, <CHARNAME>? Robberies, a-assassinations... all sorts of o-other dark deeds. And he is at the head of everything. And it probably covers the slave trade, right? All of this is... scary. ~
@402 = ~You forget, Aerie, that I myself am a Shadow Thief. ~
@403 = ~N-no, I remember. And that in itself is dangerous, but Aran... What if he's using you? ~
@404 = ~You get scared very quickly. This is life, and life is complicated. ~
@405 = ~So be it. But what if Aran is just using you?~
@406 = ~I understand that this is hard for you. But I am different. What scares you makes my blood run faster through my veins. ~
@407 = ~Yeah... and I guess it's okay to admit that you scare me sometimes, too. And at the same time, I can't help but think that Aran might just be using you. ~
@408 = ~I'm not stupid, Aerie. And I won't let anyone use me. So don't worry, Aran and I are doing great. ~
@409 = ~If so, I'll pray that my fears aren't justified. I'm sorry, <CHARNAME>. I didn't mean to hurt you. ~
@410 = ~(You take your time answering Aerie. Your eyes are staring off into the distance, and your mind's eye is filled with images of your last date with Aran... and you catch yourself smiling) No, Aerie. I am deeply convinced that there is no catch in our relationship. He really loves me. And I love him, too.. ~
@412 = ~Oh... you know, you're just glowing now when you talk about him. I-I hope... I hope I was wrong ~ [AERIE33]
@413 = ~And... <CHARNAME>... how does it feel to love? N-no, don't answer. Maybe I'll find out myself someday. ~
@414 = ~*Humming to himself*:
'Until a shadow falls on the world and covers us,
Love everyone, everyone, because that will save us!'~
@415 = ~Haer'Dalis... you're looking at me strangely.~
@416 = ~So what, my black bird? ~
@417 = ~Hmm... meaning? ~
@418 = ~Just thinking of a bird seeking under the wing of a predatory hawk. ~
@419 = ~*Laughter* That little bird, my dear bard, also has sharp claws. ~
@420 = ~Ah, you are a high-flying bird, no one doubts. A true ballad heroine, and someday all the bards of Faerûn will be at your feet. Well, in Sigil, of course, if I get to Sigil again, they will learn songs about you. I promise. ~
@421 = ~But the hawk has such delicate feathers, my friend... ~
@422 = ~Ah, even a stone would soften for you, my dear! For some reason, I'm not surprised. I'd rather not think about it, though - I'm beginning to envy the Shadow Master. ~
@423 = ~'Everything goes to hell, worlds roll into the abyss.
So come on, my dove, let's dance while we can still!'~
@424 = ~Why would you think about that? And you know, if you would sing elsewhere, your vocals are giving me a headache. ~
@425 = ~Oh, how are you with me... This is somehow... petty for you. ~
@426 = ~*Leaves and sings softly*:
'So the black rose bloomed in the garden,
And the seagull hurries to the cockatoo.
Should you wait and rush in vain?
You are different flight, dear birds!'~

// Episode 7. The Magic Lamp of Abu Khazab
@480 = ~Greetings, <PRO_SIRMAAM>! It's so good that you are here and not away on heroic deeds somewhere! The Shadow Master Aran wants to see you and told me to tell you to come as soon as possible.~
@481 = ~Thanks, I'm on my way.~
@482 = ~There you are, <CHARNAME>.~
@483 = ~*Aran comes closer and straightens a strand of your hair, and, as often happens with him, the exciting intimacy of this gesture contrasts with his harsh efficiency*~
@484 = ~You see, an important partnership is at stake. A certain influential merchant from Calimshan, Abu Khazab, with whom we do business while providing his protection, has been robbed. This could have been done either by one of the free birds or by one of ours in violation of the laws of the Guild. What do you say?~ 
@485 = ~Don't worry, whoever did this will get what they deserve. What was stolen? ~
@486 = ~A magical vessel that summons a variety of creatures, one of a kind. Looks like a genie lamp. Three days ago, the owner demonstrated its capabilities at a party in his mansion. Here, take the guest list, you might find it useful. After that, Abu Khazab locked the magic lamp in a safe. Yesterday morning, he found the safe broken open. The kidnapper knew his business, worked cleanly, and left no trace. ~
@487 = ~Was this a veteran thief at work? ~
@488 = ~I'm sure of that. ~
@489 = ~Okay Aran, I get it. I'll get started.~ 
@490 = ~*Aran's voice softens* And again, I ask you to be careful, <CHARNAME>. In our business, you never know where dangers lie.~
@491 = ~*You are carefully looking at the guest list, which contains the names of several wealthy and noble residents of Athkatla. So, where to start...*~
@492 = ~*Talk to Renal Bloodscalp*~
@493 = ~*Talk to Lathan*~
@494 = ~*Little can be hidden from Renal, who is believed by the ignorant to be the head of the Shadow Thieves of Athkatla. You decide to talk to him first) ~
@495 = ~*Lathan is your right-hand man in the guild you run, so it would be a good idea to consult with him. Perhaps this weasel can lead you on the trail*~
@496 = ~*Lathan was your right-hand man in the guild you ran. And although you lost her, it would still be nice to consult him. Perhaps this weasel can lead you on the trail*~
@497 = ~Ah, <CHARNAME>... or should I be calling you "Mistress <CHARNAME>" now? It is not customary for us to gossip, but some people cannot help but gossip about your secret elevation. Don't worry though, I always remind them that the guild doesn't like talkers. Did you want something? ~
@498 = ~Ah, <CHARNAME>... I see you are doing well. Must have been a bit of a loss for you, losing your own guild. All right, I'm not a barmaid or a gossipy woman. Did you want something? ~
@499 = ~Renal, do you know of anyone who may be operating behind the backs of the Shadow Thieves? Have we had any suspicious happenings ourselves?~
@500 = ~Hmm... Not that I know of, but I can't keep track of everyone, you know. As for free birds, here you've hit the spot. I was just about to send my boys over to teach one of them not to ignore our warnings. A small bird, indeed, a gnome who's recently arrived in Athkatla. If you wish, I can have him brought before your eyes. You'll just have to wait a little while. What do you say?~
@501 = ~OK, Renal, I'll wait. ~
@502 = ~No, unfortunately I don't have much time. ~
@503 = ~Great. I think the guys will handle it quickly. ~
@504 = ~As you wish. Then let's say goodbye, I also have a lot to do. ~
@505 = ~(You are having a good time in the guild until finally Bloodscalp's men come back from their mission. They've finished faster than you expected. A young gnome with red hair and big round eyes appears in front of you. He shivers with fear)~
@506 = ~What's your name? ~
@507 = ~Porin, your grace. I didn't mean anything bad... believe me, nothing, nothing. I just... *He sobs, clearly trying to rouse your pity*~
@508 = ~Now let's be honest. Do you know the name Abu Hazab? ~
@509 = ~Don't give me that nonsense. Spit it out, you fool. Did you rob Abu Khazab? ~
@510 = ~Baatezu take you, stop whining! Are you saying you weren't warned? ~
@511 = ~I don't give a shit about him! That moneybags... who the hell knows, but he wasn't my prey. It was just a little thing... ~
@512 = ~What's this little thing? ~
@513 = ~There was such a commotion in the Rilin house in the morning! How could I not take advantage of it? I thought I would warm my hands just once more in Athkatla... ~
@514 = ~It was my last time... I wanted to sail north to Baldur's Gate, but not empty-handed... And there was such a commotion in the Rilin house in the morning! How could I not take advantage of it? I thought I would warm my hands just once more in Athkatla... ~
@515 = ~*You recall that Lady Rilin and her daughter Azora were mentioned in the guest list Aran gave you... Interesting...*~
@516 = ~This will be your last time, don't doubt it. Stop whining and keep talking. What's with the Rilins? ~
@517 = ~Their daughter is gone! I accidentally heard that she... how was it... "was caught making inappropriate acquaintances"! She wasn't kidnapped, no. She ran away with some guy herself. And they found a note in the unwise maiden's chamber, something like "we'll meet in the Copper Coronet" or something like that. That's how it is. ~
@518 = ~(You interrogate Porin for a long time, but you learn anything new from him) ~
@519 = ~Have you talked? Well, <CHARNAME>, what do you think we should do about this misunderstanding? ~
@520 = ~Don't bother with him, Renal, just slit his throat. ~
@521 = ~Didn't you want your boys to deal with him? Well, let them. I'm not interested in him anymore. ~
@522 = ~Give him a kick, Renal, to fly to Baldur's Gate. Seriously, this misunderstanding, as you say, is not worth our time - let him go. ~
@523 = ~Oh, how kind you are. I have tears of emotion in my eyes. Oh well, have it your way.~
@524 = ~*Renal cuts Porin's throat, being careful not to stain his suit with blood*~
@525 = ~*Porin sniffles*~
@526 = ~*Porin looks at you hopefully*~
@527 = ~Well, if the spirit of mercy has descended upon you, <CHARNAME>... Get out, little fry, and if you show up in Athkatla again, you will become even smaller - by about a head. ~
@528 = ~Thank you <PRO_SIRMAAM>, thank you! *Runs away*~
@529 = ~*What to do next?*~
@530 = ~*Comparing what Lathan told you with the information received from Porin, you come to certain conclusions. You need to go to the Copper Coronet*~
@531 = ~Hello!~
@532 = ~Hi Lathan. Is everything okay in the guild? ~
@533 = ~How is my former guild doing, is everything okay? ~
@534 = ~You know... it's not okay. And I didn’t want to bother you too much, I thought we’ll figure it out ourselves. But since you're asking... ~
@535 = ~It's not okay, you know. ~
@536 = ~Jovi Gerk is missing. He was supposed to report to work yesterday morning, but he never showed up. He hasn't been seen at the Gift of the Sea, where he usually hangs out. He didn't go to jail, that's for sure, and no one found his body. ~
@537 = ~Yesterday morning, you say? Weird coincidence. What else do you know about him?~
@538 = ~Not much. They say he's got an acquaintance with a certain noblewoman. He's kind of a handsome guy. Listen, maybe she locked him in her bedroom and is not letting go out of jealousy, do you think? ~
@539 = ~*Even after learning something that you think is useful, you cannot draw any conclusions yet. Maybe you should have done what Bloodscalp advised you, but now it’s too late to talk about it. You decide, with Tony's help, to gather as much information as you can about the guests who were at Abu Hazab's party when he demonstrated the wonders of the magic lamp*~
@540 = ~Oh <PRO_SIRMAAM>! I just found out something: it turns out that Lady Rilin's daughter ran away with some suspicious type, and it could well be one of ours. In the girl's room, they found a note, which said something about a meeting in the "Copper Coronet". Is it important, do you think? ~
@541 = ~*Now you seem to know what to do. And although a lot of time has been wasted, now you are sure that the solution is waiting for you in Copper Coronet.) ~
@542 = ~*Consider all information gathered*~
@543 = ~Hi Bernard. Look, I need some information from you. ~
@544 = ~Oh, what a day. I can see it in your eyes. Are you gonna torture me with questions too? ~
@545 = ~Who's been asking you questions, my good man? ~
@546 = ~Why not, if the answers are interesting? ~
@547 = ~You love money and I love interesting stories. Let's get straight to the point. ~
@548 = ~Torture, you say? I can do more than ask questions... ~
@549 = ~You're very interested, aren't you? Someone's been here before you... it's nothing like that, believe me. They came and they went. ~
@550 = ~You're not making any sense. ~
@551 = ~Listen, my head hurts. If you are interested in sentimental stories, buy a romance novel on the Promenade. If there is nowhere else to spend money... ~
@552 = ~So why not just tell me that it's all about money? ~
@553 = ~So it is. What if my stories are not worth your money, or your money is my stories?~
@554 = ~Then one of us will be left out - hopefully not me. Although you know it's the smartest thing to do. ~
@555 = ~Don't threaten me! You don't even know what you're talking about. ~
@556 = ~What if I know? ~
@557 = ~*You can see that Bernard definitely wants to put a price on himself, he's not even hiding it very much. You've got to get him to tell you the truth somehow*~
@558 = ~*You take out your dagger and play with it, showing the wonders of your dexterity*~
@559 = ~Bernard, listen, you shouldn't piss me off. It seems to me, buddy, that you are covering up one of ours who escaped without answering some questions, and the Shadow Thieves don't like that. So shall we continue the conversation in a peaceful manner, or...? ~
@560 = ~To the Abyss with you... Okay, listen. ~
@561 = ~My weapon has pierced many... many... and many. I like you, Bernard, you are doing a good deed by welcoming adventurers to your tavern, and I will be sorry to harm you. But business is business. Nothing personal.~
@562 = ~You really have to throw threats, eh? That's a shame... Eh. Okay listen... ~
@563 = ~*You lean on the counter and look Bernard in the eyes, smiling charmingly*~
@564 = ~I could tell you a story myself. Here, listen. Once upon a time, there was one innkeeper who was very well fed and contented with life. He would have lived happily ever after, but one day, he accidentally pissed off the Shadow Thieves. That was the end of his tale. I don't know about you, but my heart breaks for that outcome.~
@565 = ~Well, as for my heart, your gaze penetrates into its very depths, I can't help it. Okay listen...~
@566 = ~*Letting Bernard understand that you already know a lot and there is no point in denying it* So, Bernard, yesterday some very determined people sent by Lady Rilin came to see you and demanded to know if her daughter Azora had appeared at the Copper Coronet. And they were unlikely to be willing to pay for their story. You blurted out something to them to discourage them, but what was it? Let's get this story straight. ~
@567 = ~I knew you were looking for that couple too. The guy is from the Shadow Thieves, right? Okay listen... ~
@568 = ~I'm tired of this gimmick. Here's 100 gold for you - and lay out what is happening here. ~
@569 = ~That’s right. Okay listen. ~
@570 = ~A couple showed up here last night... right, it's not uncommon, but one was a noble girl - it was immediately obvious. She was kind of upset, even scared, and the guy was comforting her. I brought them hot wine and then led them to the entrance to the sewer... just think - such a girl and into the sewer! She paid me well, said that if they look for her here, I should lie as if I overheard them agreeing to flee to Trademeet. ~
@571 = ~In the morning, armed men did show up and bombarded me with questions. They were not very kind, and most importantly, I did not receive a dime from them. But they believed me, praise Timor. ~
@572 = ~I wouldn't say anything to you either, because I was paid to remain silent. But, firstly, you are good at persuasion, and secondly... you know, I would like you to find this girl and bring her back to her mother. Look in the sewers to see if you can find them. I got a feeling I'm gonna be in trouble if the deception gets out. Anyway, if you can, do something. She didn't look happy. ~
//@573 = ~*Letting Bernard understand that you already know a lot and there is no point in denying it*~
@574 = ~I have no money. ~
@575 = ~Well then I have nothing to say, buddy. Sorry.~ 
@576 = ~*You find a magic lamp near a petrified couple - the hapless lovers fell prey to a basilisk, which, apparently, they themselves summoned with the lamp for some reason. Such creatures are not found in these places. I have the lamp now, and Aran's task is done.*~
@577 = ~That's it. ~
@578 = ~*You are holding Abu Hazab's magic lamp in your hands, and you can directly physically feel how powerful magic is hidden in it. Better not even risk using it. Be that as it may, you now have the lamp, and Aran's task is completed*~
@583 = ~Ah... what... ugh, <CHARNAME>! They tracked me down! (Looks around) ~
@584 = ~Azora? Where is Azora? Never mind. I knew it wouldn't end well. For you, too, by the way. ~
@585 = ~Azora... so did she...? Never mind. I knew it wouldn't end well. For you, too, by the way. ~
@586 = ~You're coming with me. ~
@587 = ~You want a fight, you got one. ~
@588 = ~Idiot, I saved you! ~ 
@589 = ~No way, buddy! You think I don't know what we do to people who break guild rules? I don't give up my freedom for nothing!~
@590 = ~What did you think? You'd take me alive? It won't work! ~
@591 = ~Yes, to hand me over to the bosses. Don't you know what will happen to me? So thank you, you shouldn't have. Now die. ~
@592 = ~So it's done! Congratulations, <CHARNAME>. Yes, this is the same lamp. Old man Abu will be delighted. These Calimshan people run around with their artifacts like children with toys. Of course, it's a pity that Azora Rilin didn't work out very well, and my curiosity, to be honest, is not satisfied, but these are little things. ~
@593 = ~I will order the statue of Jovi to be delivered to the guild and placed in a prominent place - as a warning to others. ~
@594 = ~So it's done! Congratulations, <CHARNAME>. Yes, this is the same lamp. Old man Abu will be delighted. These Calimshan people run around with their artifacts like children with toys. Of course, it's a pity that it didn't work out very well with Azora Rilin, and my curiosity, to be honest, is not satisfied. But at least we can sell her mother information on where to look for... um... the statue of Azora, and this lady can afford the help of a priest. ~
@595 = ~Take it, you deserve a reward.~
@596 = ~Y-you... did you kill it? That monster? Praise to Mystra! ~
@597 = ~Are you Azora Rilin? Stop stuttering and tell me what happened. ~
@598 = ~Calm down, Azora, the thing is dead. What's going on here? ~
@599 = ~Of course I killed him! I felled these in batches in the vicinity of Baldur's Gate. You'd better tell me what's going on here.~
@600 = ~I-I'm just... I'm coming to my senses now, yeah. Ugh, I feel a little better. I'll tell you everything, and then you'll walk me home, right? ~
@601 = ~Anyway... it's my love of beauty... Jovi seemed so beautiful... and that bird too... Now, now I'll tell you everything in order. ~
@602 = ~Jovi Gerk saw me in the Government District when he said he was cleaning the pockets of a nobleman. He fell in love at first sight and did everything to achieve a meeting with me in private. And I returned his feelings... ~
@603 = ~What happened next? ~
@604 = ~We started dating in secret. Jovi begged me to run away with him, but I did not dare. But a couple of days ago, my mother and I went to visit a Kalimshite, and he demonstrated the miracles of the magic lamp before the meeting. With her help, he summoned a large bird of unprecedented beauty - it all burned with fire and shimmered with all the colors of the rainbow! And I realized that I would not know peace if this lamp was not mine. But my mother refused to try to buy it. ~
@605 = ~And then you suggested that Jovi steal it for you? ~
@606 = ~Yes. In return, I finally agreed to run away with him. ~
@607 = ~So you were willing to ruin your life for a magic trinket? ~
@608 = ~No, I didn't think so then! I really loved Jovi. It seemed to me that our life together would be fabulously interesting! ~
@609 = ~You're just a silly spoiled girl! Because of you, the Shadow Thief framed his guild. I should leave you to the basilisk. ~
@610 = ~An idiotic fantasy. Okay, tell me more. ~
@611 = ~Love really does make your head spin. What happened then? ~
@612 = ~*Her eyes fill with tears* No, don't say that! ~
@613 = ~Jovi said he'd do anything for me. If it worked out, he'd put a time and place in a note to meet me. And so he did: his friend secretly handed me a letter... at one o'clock in the morning at the Copper Coronet... ~
@614 = ~So Jovi wanted you to trudge through the city at night to a poor neighborhood? ~
@615 = ~No, his friend walked me out! Actually, I have an invisibility cloak in case of danger, very handy. I mean, everything went according to plan, but when I found myself in the poor neighborhood, and then in this tavern, I felt uncomfortable. ~
@616 = ~Of course, this is very different from your usual life. ~
@617 = ~You understand me! After all, Jovi described everything differently. And, no, I didn't give up at the first difficulty. But he decided to take me through the sewers, said that here he had hidden some savings from the time he helped some slave traders. And that's when I started to feel bad. ~
@618 = ~I'm surprised Jovi didn't abandon you when he realized you'd become a liability.. ~
@619 = ~But he didn't! To distract me and cheer me up, Jovi gave me the magic lamp... I tried to summon that wonderful bird... and this creature appeared! It immediately turned Jovi into stone, and I... I... I just had time to activate the magic of the cloak. And I wandered here, trembling with fear, going crazy, not knowing what to do next... I had already decided to show myself to the monster just so that it would stop my torment! If you came just a minute later, I would... (crying) ~
@620 = ~A sad story, Azora. Now give me the lamp and I will walk you home. ~
@621 = ~Yes, of course, take it! I can't stand to look at it now! And Jovi? ~
@622 = ~He has robbed a Shadow Thief patron and will remain stone as punishment. ~
@623 = ~Jovi? Perhaps we should try to restore him. I'm curious what he has to say. ~
@624 = ~No, please! I... I don't love him anymore. But I do not want such a fate for him! Please. ~
@625 = ~His fate would have been unenviable anyway. Come on, Azora. We have nothing else to do here. ~
@626 = ~*Sobs* Okay. Take my cloak in gratitude for my salvation. I don’t want anything to remind of this story. I... I will try not to be such a fool again, I promise. Let's go. ~
@627 = ~Okay, I'll wait. I won't budge without you. ~
@628 = ~Ah... what... ugh, <CHARNAME>! You've tracked down yet! (Looks around) Azora! My love, a lovely girl, accustomed to expensive toys... who ruined my life for one of them! ~
@629 = ~What are you talking about? I agreed to run away with you! ~
@630 = ~But we didn't get far. Shadow Thieves... they would have gotten to us anywhere sooner or later. If only I hadn't been so intoxicated by your beautiful eyes... But you know what? I don't want anyone else to kiss you when you forget me. So... Goodbye, my princess! ~
@631 = ~What a bastard you are. ~
@632 = ~You've had your fun, haven't you? Now come with me ~
@633 = ~While she deserves it, restoring you was a mistake... which I'll fix now. ~
@634 = ~You will be next. ~ 
@635 = ~Yeah right! You'll be the one who goes next! ~
@636 = ~How arrogant! We'll see who falls.~
@637 = ~So it's done! Congratulations, <CHARNAME>. Yes, this is the right lamp. Old man Abu will be delighted. These Calimshan people run around with their artifacts like children with toys. It's a curious story, though. ~
@638 = ~It's a shame we couldn't rescue Azora Rilin, but at least we can sell her mother information on where to find her daughter's body, and this lady can surely afford a priest's help. ~
@639 = ~Plus, we can now charge Lady Rilin a pretty big sum for saving her daughter... and for her silence. She was too proud of her family's infallible reputation. ~
@640 = ~I will order the statue of Jovi to be delivered to the guild and placed in a prominent place - as a warning to others. So it's all worked out. ~

// Conversation with Aran after the quest
@641 = ~*Aran peers into your face*~ [aransong]
@642 = ~<CHARNAME>... Is it just me, or are you paler than usual? Are you feeling well? ~
@643 = ~You're right, Aran... I'm a little unwell. But... (You pull Aran close with a gentle kiss and gaze into his eyes) Here... with you... I can just forget about it, like everything else. ~
@644 = ~No, darling, that won't do. Come on, make yourself comfortable... I will treat you to tea - it has a spicy taste and mesmerizing aroma, and it is wonderfully relaxing. This tea, from Shou Lung, I brew for myself and drink alone when I want to forget my surroundings for a while. But now, I'm happy to change this habit - there are two of us today. ~
@645 = ~*Few people get the opportunity to feel the care of the Shadow Master, but you know all its hidden depth. Aran looks after you as if you were made of precious fragile glass, and it seems that you have been transported to another plane of the Multiverse*~
@646 = ~Aran... You are so gentle with me... why? .. ~
@647 = ~Because, <CHARNAME>, it's you. Because you are who you are. Only you awaken in me these feelings, ones I'd hidden so deeply and long forgotten. And it makes me feel good. ~
@648 = ~*He kisses you on the cheek*: Thank you, darling... ~
@649 = ~I'm fine, Aran, this unpleasant story just got on my nerves a little. ~
@650 = ~*You take his hand and stroke it gently, slowly*~
@651 = ~*Aran looks at you carefully, then runs his fingertips over your face like a blind man*~
@652 = ~And yet you're tired. Not from this assignment, no. GNot from this assignment, no. Not from everything that's been weighing on you. You are fragile, <CHARNAME>, although you have an iron rod in you if even Irenicus failed to break you. But if the blow is even stronger? What is left then? ~
@653 = ~The essence of the offspring of Bhaal? ~
@654 = ~Your nature is extremely difficult to understand... but I believe that you, the you that now trembles at my touch, will never be destroyed by anything, no matter what your father's blood does to you. Now... I'm ready to give you rest, oblivion, consolation, call it what you want. We can relax with a cup of Shou Lung tea or make love... Whatever you want. You and I still have time... ~
@655 = ~Well now! That's a good thought... *You wrap your arms around Aran's neck* Can you tell that I've recently visited the sewers? Of course, I cleaned myself up and rested a little before meeting you, Aran... I've been looking forward to this. ~
@656 = ~*Aran willingly shares your enthusiasm...*~
@657 = ~Bright... passionate... how lucky I am to have you, <CHARNAME>! Yes... but this clasp is not easy to open. It’s no more difficult, however, than breaking a cunning lock on a rich chest... but its precious contents are nothing compared to the treasures this lacing hides... ~
@658 = ~What about your defense mechanisms, Aran? ~
@659 = ~*Laughs* Oh, I have no formidable traps or complex locks for you! And yet... ~
@660 = ~*He picks you up, throws you on the bed, and immediately rushes after you*~
@661 = ~We'll both have to work hard to learn more of each other's secrets. Shall we? ~

@662 = ~<CHARNAME>, let's restore these two! I feel so sorry for them... Petrified, in the middle of a terrible sewer... ~ [AERIE33]
@663 = ~<CHARNAME>, these people need to be restored. It doesn't matter why they ended up here or who they are, you can't leave them like that. ~
@664 = ~Grab the lamp and let's go to Aran. He’s going to pay a lot of money for this thing! Those assholes are to blame for all of this anyway. ~
@665 = ~<CHARNAME>, let me study this lamp... There may be great power hidden in it. We'd better take it for ourselves instead of giving it to Aran! ~
@666 = ~No, Edwin. Look what happened when the previous owner tried to use it. Let's not risk it. ~
@667 = ~Pff. These fools had no idea how these things work. Unlike me. Well, suit yourself. (What a fool, missing this chance!) ~
@668 = ~These lovers wanted to be together forever, and their wish came true. What a plot for a ballad! But it's better not to sing about the sewers. I'll change it to someplace else. ~
@669 = ~It's not for nothing that they say - be careful what you wish for, it may not come true as planned. ~
@670 = ~Let's go, <CHARNAME>. These idiots don't deserve to be saved. Let them stand here until they crumble to dust. ~
@671 = ~Here, <CHARNAME>, is a clear example of the need for caution in all things. ~
@672 = ~(grim) Here are the victims of nefarious magic. Do as you like, <CHARNAME>, but if I were you, I would try to save them from this fate. ~
@673 = ~Ha! It seems this maiden is as unlucky as you, <CHARNAME>. She fell for a thief, and look where it got her. ~
@674 = ~<CHARNAME>, let's restore him! Poor thing... petrified, in the middle of a terrible sewer... ~
@675 = ~<CHARNAME>, you need to restore this man. Even if he was dishonorable, you shouldn't leave him like that. ~
@676 = ~Let's go, <CHARNAME>. This idiot doesn't deserve to be rescued. Let him stand there until he crumbles to dust. ~
@677 = ~Grab the lamp and let's go to Aran. He’s going to pay a lot of money for this thing! This idiot is to blame anyway. ~
@678 = ~(grim) Here is the victim of nefarious magic. Do as you like, <CHARNAME>, but if I were you, I would try to save him from this fate. ~
@679 = ~<CHARNAME>, in the name of Tempus, we must restore these people! I went through the same thing, and I know that there is nothing worse than standing like this without hope of salvation. Even the worst thief does not deserve such a fate. ~
@680 = ~These fools cannot serve the great Tiax while they stand like idols! I command you to break this spell so that they can greet the future ruler of the world! And bring some salted nuts, I'm hungry.~
@681 = ~<CHARNAME>, in the name of Tempus, we must disenchant this man! I went through the same thing, and I know that there is nothing worse than standing like this without hope of salvation. Even the worst thief does not deserve such a fate. ~

// Group Reactions (Leena)
@694 = ~This is not how justice is done, <CHARNAME>, and it grieves me to see you participate in this.~
@695 = ~This is a sacrilege against nature, <CHARNAME>. When animals fight, they do not toy with each other like this. Who will take care of her son if she dies from this torment?~
@696 = ~Yes, this is not a pleasant sight. But this is how the game is played. It's us or them. This woman will be lucky if Aran decides to spare her life. But this is not my concern anymore.~
@697 = ~You are right, <CHARNAME>. This wretch is lucky that she is not in the Underdark among my people. There, she would learn what real torture feels like.~
@698 = ~If you ask me, <CHARNAME>, I would say that was reckless and stupid. Sometimes I think I will never understand you surface dwellers. Your nonsensical behavior astounds me.~
@699 = ~I guess some would say that Shadow Thieves don't act like that, right? But you know, <CHARNAME>, I am awfully happy that you did this!~
@700 = ~Justice would demand that this woman be given into the hands of the law. She was working with the enemies of Amn after all. But this is better than sending her to your Guild's torture chamber would have been.~
@701 = ~Ha! You know, <CHARNAME>, I think you are actually going to get away with this. The Guildmaster favors you, and you managed to foil his enemies' plans. But keep in mind, you're taking a great risk acting on your merciful whims like this.~
@702 = ~ I will tell my Order about this place and come back here with some of my brothers. These scoundrels will answer for everything that they've done.~
@703 = ~ This place is rotten to the core. It would be easier to burn down everything in here than it is to find a tiniest drop of humanity in these creatures.~
@704 = ~Moments like this make me realize why some Druids like animals more than people.~
@705 = ~Do you think that Aran's people would have met with more mercy in the hands of Riatavin spies? This is war! So enough of this. As long as you are with me, none of you will threaten the Shadow Thieves.~
@706 = ~<CHARNAME>, this is impossible to watch. If my magic flares up spontaneously and destroys everything here, I won't be responsible.~

@708 = ~Yes, Yoshimo, I'm listening. ~
@709 = ~You are probably used to walking on a tight thread over an abyss, and my warning will seem ridiculous to you. But you should beware the Shadow Master! This is not a man to be taken lightly. ~
@710 = ~Of course, Yoshimo, you're right. It is unacceptable to take him lightly. But to love him... ~
@711 = ~Mind your own business, Yoshimo. ~

@718 = ~Think, Mazzy, what would the world be like if we only loved the worthy? Love is not a prize for winning a knightly tournament. It just... is. And it recognizes no cause or condition. ~

@724 = ~(You are still looking at the same intense, energetic leader of the Shadow Thieves you’ve come to know, but something barely perceptible in his eyes, his smile, his gesture of welcome says that he looks at you differently from all his other subordinates)~
@725 = ~(You feel a yearning within yourself, a yearning to be closer to him, you feel fascinated by this man, and even more... you almost regret refusing him earlier. Maybe you weren’t honest with yourself then... Could it not be too late to make things right?) Aran... believe it or not, but I am also happy to see you. Very happy.~
@726 = ~(You feel that you don't really need Aran to single you out. It would be better if you stuck to a strictly business relationship. So you don't say anything and just give a half-bow in response. Aran nods.) Did you summon me here for a task or...?~
@727 = ~ My friend, I like the tone of your voice when you say that...~
@728 = ~(You handle the code with ease, creating a false report to be passed to Riatavin. Aran is very pleased and expresses his pleasure by tenderly squeezing your shoulder. His hand is warm and strong, despite being slender. You cover it with your own hand affectionately, as if entering some mysterious contract with the Shadow Master.)~

@736 = ~Yes, Nalia? What is it? ~
@737 = ~There's no time to talk now, Nalia. Let's talk later. ~
@738 = ~Your relationship with this person... Aran. Don't get me wrong, I don't want to get into your private life. But do you realize how fragile and unreliable such a relationship is?~
@739 = ~Although I am a bit of a thief myself, this has never been my main profession. And I was never in danger, even if I was caught. A noble lineage has certain advantages, although I have never clung to it, and could have given up on them even now. ~
@740 = ~But these people... Shadow Thieves... They live on the edge. Every day they can be killed from around the corner by competitors, the guards can arrest them. Your Aran could be poisoned by his own subordinates to take his place. Are you not acting rashly in handing over your heart to someone who participates in the dark deeds that take place on the streets at night?~
@741 = ~I've been thinking about it, Nalia. But the feeling that binds us is not a light changeable wind. It's like... a storm that is useless to resist. ~
@742 = ~Have you ever loved someone so much that all your thoughts went back to that person over and over again? When everything else paled in his shadow? If not, you can hardly understand me. ~
@743 = ~I know. And that is why I will never betray him. There are too few people around him to rely on. He believes in me, and I also believe in him. And I will not give up, even if it is a risk. After all, my whole life has filled with risk from my youth. And maybe that's why I'm more suited to him than anyone else. ~
@744 = ~You know, I've had my doubts for a long time, but I've been silencing them. And when you spoke, it was like I heard my inner voice come out in full force. Maybe we should stop. I'll think about what you said... ~
@745 = ~I appreciate your concern, but it only concerns me and Aran. ~
@746 = ~This is none of your business, Nalia. Leave me alone! ~
@747 = ~Okay, then I'm sorry. I will not distract. ~
@748 = ~I... Now I understand. Sometimes things don't turn out the way we expect. But the commands of the heart sound louder than the voice of reason. And we play with the cards that are dealt to us. ~
@749 = ~Yes, I've never felt that way. I can't say that I've loved anyone the way it was described in the books  I read in my youth in the castle library... Secretly, because my aunt did not approve of reading romance novels. So, you are right, it's not for me to judge. Sorry. ~
@750 = ~You are brave, <CHARNAME>. You cannot be broken. That's probably why of all the people I asked for help when my castle was attacked, you were the only one who didn't back down in the face of danger. ~

"My dear.
I am writing to warn you. The men I sent to Riatavin have failed, and I know my enemies are preparing to strike back. Please be careful! Where you are now going, you should beware of the magician Altar. He is very dangerous. (Here Aran gives a detailed description of Altar, one of Riatavin's best agents.) Try not to meet with him, but if you do, kill him before he attacks first.
Just in case, I'm sending Tony an antidote to the poison which I know he loves to use.

@806 = ~(You take the letter from Tony. Of course, it is from Aran) ~
@807 = ~(Aran... this name gives you a surge of love and affection. You breathe a sigh of relief. At least this test is over) ~
@808 = ~Tony, how did you find me here? ~
@809 = ~I was coming to you, too late, alas. I saw you being carried through the forest and hurried in the shadows behind your captors. And then I looked out the window at... all this... and I could not help you! It was so terrible... ~
@810 = ~You've helped a lot, Tony, thank you my friend. And I think I should write to Aran now. ~
@811 = ~Take care of yourself, Lady <CHARNAME>! ~
@812 = ~(You find your comrades in a daze, which you take remove with the antidote Tony gave you) ~
@813 = ~I had a strange dream today... ~
@814 = ~Yes, something happened... what was that, <CHARNAME>? ~
@815 = ~I don't remember anything. ~
@816 = ~Me too.~
@817 = ~What's up?~
@818 = ~I've gotten myself into an unpleasant adventure here... ~
@819 = ~(You tell your friends everything that happened to you) ~
@820 = ~From now on, we must triple our vigilance and not be caught off guard. We are surrounded by enemies. Let's not forget that. ~
@821 = ~(There are great challenges ahead... Before you go to Elhan, you decide to rest in the forest and recuperate) ~
@822 = ~How's it going?~
@823 = ~Don't you want to talk yet? ~
@824 = ~(Back to the place where you spent the night, trying to get away from what happened) ~
@825 = ~Stubborn woman! ~
@826 = ~(You are trying to make love really be stronger than pain and death, like it is in ballads and novels. It's all too hard, and you finally faint) ~
@827 = ~(A black, uncontrollable rage fills you. And something happens that your executioners never expected) ~
@828 = ~I'll be brief because time is short. We're going to pay Aran Linvail a visit, and we hope very much for your cooperation. Tell us how best to infiltrate your Shadow Master's quarters, who guards him, if he has any weaknesses we can exploit. ~
@829 = ~Tell me everything you know. You yourself understand that this is not really a request. ~
@579 = ~(Aran silently presses you to his chest. He knows what you have endured for him, but does not say unnecessary words, just strokes your hair. And only then quietly says: "I will avenge you") ~

// Group reactions (episode 8, sleepover)
@830 = ~Y-yes, <CHARNAME>, we are tired, and anything can lie ahead. Let's rest, please! ~
@831 = ~For the first time in my life, I agree with this mewling kitten! I need to prepare my spells for the decisive battle! (And I am also hungry, and this elf cooks stews well... At least that is useful, since she is not capable of anything in battle!) ~
@832 = ~A wise thought. I need to prepare my spells for the decisive battle! (I'm also hungry...) ~
@833 = ~Indeed! When I'm tired, the sight of enemy's guts is not so pleasant! But when I'm rested, I'm ready to chop right and left, first come, first serve, ha ha!~
@834 = ~Since we have decided to take a break, let me remind you that today is my turn to cook... And since the decisive battle is ahead, I will cook a special dish to cheer everyone up! It will be a thick turnip soup with Tethyrian pepper cheese! This is a mixture of goat and cow cheese mixed with southern spices. When you add it to turnip soup, you will lick your fingers! In our family, this secret recipe was passed on from generation to generation... And my great-great-great-great-grandmother came up with it, peace be upon her. That day, she was very angry with her great-great-great-great-grandfather - because of what? On that, history is silent... ~
@835 = ~Either way, she was very angry with him and decided to take her terrible revenge. Knowing that he couldn't live without turnip soup, she threw a huge chunk of pepper cheese in it to ruin the taste! She served it up, expecting to see his face contort and hear screams of horror. But instead, he ate the whole bowl and asked for more! And he praised her culinary talent so much that she melted and forgave him at that very moment. They lived happily ever after, and every day she cooked him that soup. And when they both left for the heavenly turnip beds, this recipe was inherited by my great-great-great-grandmother, she left it to my great-great-grandmother, and that... ~
@836 = ~We get it, Jan, you don't have to go on! Start cooking, you've talked us into it!~
@837 = ~Gods, not this! I'd rather eat tree beetles! ~
@838 = ~Try it before you judge, you idiot! ~
@839 = ~Any objections? ~

// Additions (episode 8, conversation with Gorion)
@840 = ~Father! I missed you so much... ~
@841 = ~Gorion... good to see you again ~
@842 = ~But I have always been with you, even if you haven't seen me. ~
@843 = ~We'll meet again - in much kinder dreams. ~
@844 = ~Sorry... I've hardly remembered you. ~
@845 = ~But I've never forgotten you. ~
@846 = ~I have not honored your memory very well. ~
@847 = ~I always knew you didn't have any real daughterly feelings for me. But could I blame you for that?~
@848 = ~Now... pull yourself together, <CHARNAME>. Just a little more, you can take it ~
@849 = ~Will you send me back to this pain? ~
@850 = ~Thank you for everything, Father! But I want to go back - I can still fight... for Aran. ~
@851 = ~Thank you... this respite was needed. And now I'm ready to go back - these fools won't get their way. ~
@852 = ~You can't stay with me - your path is not complete. And don't you want to see Aran again?~
@853 = ~You're right! I'm ready. ~
@854 = ~Yes, my daughter. That's right. ~
@855 = ~Hold on - there isn't much left. And remember - I'm near. ~
@856 = ~Cheer up, <CHARNAME>.~

// Additions (Group Reactions)
@857 = ~Likely this thief wants to partake of the wisdom of Tiax, but hesitates to approach me directly, afraid of my wrath. He needs you as a go-between. Please allay his fears, <CHARNAME>, and reassure him that Tiax will gladly listen to any of his future lackeys!~ [PPTIAX10]
@858 = ~Don't worry, <CHARNAME>, all your enemies will get what they deserve! Tiax the Terrible will punish everyone who gets in your way. After all, you are one of his most loyal servants, and he knows how to be grateful! ~ [PPTIAX12]
@859 = ~Thank you, little Tiax. You are strange... but you are a good friend. ~
@860 = ~These scoundrels tortured a defenseless girl and left unpunished! I swear, <CHARNAME>, I'll find them and make them answer for everything! ~
@861 = ~These villains tortured a defenseless girl! If I were there, I would have chopped them to pieces on the spot! ~
@862 = ~What a mess, <CHARNAME>! What kind of animals could do that! ~
@863 = ~<CHARNAME>, I don't mean to sound callous, but I warned you - a relationship with the head of the Thieves Guild is fraught with consequences. Which, of course, doesn't excuse the behavior of these... monsters. I wanted to call them beasts, but even the wildest beasts don't deserve such an insulting comparison. ~
@864 = ~So you were out there fighting a bunch of bandits, and I was stuck here, enchanted to be still as a log, and missed everything? Bah! How can I look other dwarves in the eye now?!~
@865 = ~<CHARNAME>, I remember Irenicus's torture well and I understand what you went through. But you helped and saved me. I couldn't help you... Sorry. ~
@866 = ~You had nothing to do with it, Imoen. And you couldn't have helped - this magician had foreseen everything. Forget it, it's over. ~
@867 = ~You're a charmer, Dorn. You know your way around a woman. ~
@868 = ~I didn't ask you! Fuck off!~
@869 = ~Oh <CHARNAME>! You had to suffer in the name of love, and in the most direct and cruel sense! I'm very sorry, but it's not for nothing that I thought you were the true heroine of the ballad. ~
@870 = ~*Looking at the faces of those around you, you see genuine excitement.*~
@871 = ~*You look around your companions.*~
@872 = ~<CHARNAME>, I'm afraid to imagine what you've been through. And endured... I don't think Aran has ever had a more loyal person around. I hope he appreciates your loyalty the way it deserves. ~
@873 = ~Who was that mage, <CHARNAME>? You say he called himself Altar? Hmm-hmmmm... I think I've heard of a wizard with that name. Self-taught, but talented, I must admit. Did you find any magical books or writings on his corpse? It would be interesting to examine them... ~

// NEW (v.3.1)
@874 = ~Oh, <CHARNAME>, of course I knew you were very brave, but now you surprise me... again. You and Aran Linvail... You play a virtuoso game with this dark fire, huh? It's not my business to advise something in personal matters, just please, be careful not to burn yourself. ~
@875 = ~Ah, Garrick. Love inspires, don't you know? ~
@876 = ~Yes... I know that. Although it happens in a different way... hmm. Your love story does not leave the bard's heart indifferent. But do not worry, I will not expand on this in my work, I understand everything. ~
@877 = ~Garrick, your interest in this topic scares me a little. I don’t want everyone around to know about my relationship with Aran because of your writing. ~
@878 = ~It was rude, but I understand your concerns. Don't worry, singing the deeds of the daughter of Bhaal, I will leave your love under a veil of shadow. ~
@879 = ~You're messing with your own business again, bard.~
@880 = ~Wow... but I thought that Aran is a sophisticated person and appreciates good manners in a woman. I was wrong, huh? ~
@881 = ~Shadows and intrigues, new dangers and adventures... and it's all love! Love for the mysterious and powerful Shadow Master. Ah, <CHARNAME>, I won't warn you, you don't need it. I'd rather be happy for you and wish you luck. ~
@882 = ~What brutality! Isn't it possible to try to learn something from this woman in a less barbaric way? When you come across such scenes over and over again, you involuntarily begin to doubt that life is so beautiful... ~
@883 = ~What is this?! How can that be? She's a woman! So what if she is a traitor is not a reason to crush a beautiful flower so cruelly in the grip of excruciating pain... Oh, humans, humans... however, sometimes the elves are no better. ~
@884 = ~And the drama is here! Reading or listening to ballads about such stories is one thing, but participating in them yourself... is not always pleasant. ~
@885 = ~It's a shame the love story ended so badly. And was there any love here? This feeling brings joy and excitement, not... that's not all. ~
@886 = ~Ah, <CHARNAME>, that's what I feared! The fact that loving someone like Aran can bring you more than just joy. ~
@887 = ~Like love for anyone, Garrick. But without risk, there would be no happiness. ~
@888 = ~Probably so, but... Come on, I'm chatting. I am very glad that you are doing well now. ~
@889 = ~Thanks, Garrick.~
@890 = ~Have you ever loved someone so much that all your thoughts went back to that person over and over again? When everything else paled in his shadow? I'm sure the answer is yes. This means that you can quite understand me. ~
@891 = ~Yes, <CHARNAME>, you're right. I myself did not notice how I fell in love, and now I know how overwhelming this feeling is. Of course, Garrick is not Aran, with him, I'm sure everything is different, and nevertheless... Yes, I understand you. And then I just wish you happiness. ~

@892 = ~Greetings, <PRO_SIRMAAM>! It's so good that you are here and not away on heroic deeds somewhere! The Shadow Master Aran wants to see you and told me to tell you to come as soon as possible.~
@893 = ~Once again, I want to thank you for dealing with Bodhi. You have proven yourself a worthy member of our guild, so I decided to entrust you with one task. ~
@894 = ~Good luck <CHARNAME>. I trust you will not fail.~
@895 = ~Ah, <CHARNAME>... Your victory over the vampire is the stuff of legends around here. It was a good job, and it's good that you are with us, buddy. But did you want something? ~
@896 = ~(You gaze into Bernard's eyes, as if trying to subdue his will)~
