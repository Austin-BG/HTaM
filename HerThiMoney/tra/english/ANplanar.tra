@1 = ~And this Valygar refused it! He would prefer death to discovering his true potential!~
@2 = ~You mages are all alike - vain and arrogant. You think only about gaining more power. That is why your kind is despised.~
@3 = ~And who cares for you, baboon? Your animal friends? Only they will mourn your demise. But the names of great wizards live on forever.~
@4 = ~You can say whatever you want. I couldn't care less what you think. I have my way and I'm not going to change it.~
@5 = ~You are just a fool.~
